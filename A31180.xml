            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And that theſe Sums of Mony ſhould be paid to the uſe of the Mayor, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and Citizens: And if any refuſed to pay, then to be removed from his Place in the Market. And that by colour of this Law the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens for their own private Gain, had Illegally by the ſpace of Seven Years next after the making this Ordinance, received divers great Sums of Mony, in all amounting to 5000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in oppreſſion of the Kings Subjects.</p>

            <p>By which the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens aforeſaid the Priviledge, Liberty and Franchiſe of being a Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique and Corporate did forfeit, and afterwards by the time in the Information, that Liberty and Franchiſe of being a Body Politique, did uſurp upon the King. <hi>Et hoc,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That divers of theſe Conſpirators had lain in wait for him and murthered him, to the intent to ſuppreſs his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and to deter other Magiſtrates from acting in the Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Green</hi> and others were try'd, and hang'd for this Murther.</p>

            <p>That <hi>Coleman</hi> and others were alſo try'd, and executed for the ſame Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>That <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> were Impeached by the Commons in Parliament of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> for the ſame Conſpiracies, and ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the King in his Speech to that Parliament had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them the further purſuit and examination of that Conſpiracy, declaring he thought not himſelf nor them ſafe, till that matter were gone through with; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was neceſſary that the ſaid Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> ſhould be brought to their Trials, that Juſtice might be done; and the Parliament having made an Addreſs to the King, wherein both Lords and Commons declared their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply ſenſible of the ſad condition of the Realm, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned chiefly by the Conſpiracies of a Popiſh Party, who had plotted and intended the Deſtruction of the King, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government and Religion of the Kingdom; and thereupon a Solemn Faſt kept purſuant to the Kings Proclamation, grounded upon the ſaid Addreſs, and divers Bills prepared to be paſs'd into Laws for preſervation of his Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>Theſe Impeachments and Bills being thus depending, and the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> not Tryed, the Parliament was upon the 10th of <hi>January</hi> prorogued, as the Attorney General above in his Replication hath alledged, by reaſon whereof the Citizens and Inhabitants of the ſaid City being faithful Subjects to the King, were much diſquieted with the ſenſe and apprehenſions of the Danger threatning the Perſon of the King, his Government and Realm, by reaſon of the Conſpiracies aforeſaid, as is by both King and Parliament affirmed and declared; and conceiving no better means to prevent, than by the Sitting of the Parliament; and having received a Petition from divers faithful Subjects, Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> to the ſame effect: And it being lawful to Petition, the Mayor, Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> and the Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Common Council aſſembled, for the preſervation of the King and his Government did cauſe to be written the Petition in the Replication mentioned, which is ſet forth

            <p>THE Attorney General as to the Plea of the Mayor,<note place="margin">Surrejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> and Commonalty and Citizens pleaded to the making and publiſhing the Ordinance about the Markets,</p>

            <p>The Firſt of theſe Queſtions truly I ſhould not make any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion at all, but that this Caſe has been a Caſe of ſo great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every man hath diſcourſed about it, and the prejudice that ſome have entertained concerning it, have drawn them to aſſert the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Propoſition. Therefore, my Lord, becauſe this ſtrikes to the whole, though I think it hath no Foundation in Law, I will beg leave to remove this Objection out of the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Firſt of all, No Corporation hath any other Creation than any other Franchiſes have, and ſubſiſt upon the ſame Terms that other Franchiſes do.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> There is a Truſt or a Condition in Law, that is annexed to, and grows upon all Franchiſes, that they be not abuſed, and the Breach of them is a Forfeiture of the very being of the Franchiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> And as there is no Foundation of that Opinion in Law, ſo the Miſchiefs would be great, if the Law were otherwiſe. For,</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103424:8"/>
            <p>Firſt, That no Corporation hath any other Creation than other Franchiſes have; 'tis undoubtedly true that the King is the Original and Commencement of all Franchiſes; they have their beginning from him, the Books are clear and full in it: I need not quote them, though there are many, <hi>Kelway 138. 17 Ed. 2. 530.</hi> in the Reports of thoſe times ſet forth by Mr. Serjeant <hi>Maynard.</hi> Now, my Lord, there can be no Corporation, but by the Kings Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; for even the Preſcription doth ſuppoſe there was the Kings Patent to create it at firſt. And therefore the proper Inquiry will be about the Second thing.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> How far the Breach of Truſt that is annexed to a Franchiſe, is a Forfeiture of that Franchiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, There is no Rule in Law more certain, than that the Miſ-uſer of a Franchiſe is a Forfeiture of that Franchiſe. This the Statute of <hi>18 Ed. 2.</hi> does very well prove, which was an Act of Grace to reſtore Franchiſes to thoſe that had loſt and forfeited them. There it was reſtrained <hi>Ita quod libertat' non ſint abuſae.</hi> And my Lord <hi>Coke 2 Inſt.</hi> in his Obſervations upon the Statute of <hi>Weſtm' 1.</hi> That Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it that concerns Towns that exacted more Murage than was granted, <hi>fol. 223.</hi> ſays, They ſhall loſe that Grant for ever; ſays the <hi>Mirror. of Juſt.</hi> which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> there quotes, that is no more than the Common Law; for the Law wills that every Man ſhould loſe his Franchiſe, that does miſuſe it: So the Abbot of St. <hi>Albans</hi> Caſe, <hi>8 Hen. 4.18.</hi> The King ſeized the Franchiſe into his hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Abbot, who had the Goal, would not give Pledges to make Deliverance, and for detaining his Priſoners a long time without making a lawful Deliverance. And ſo <hi>20 Ed. 4. 6.</hi> The Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi>'s Caſe for detaining Priſoners acquitted; after Fees paid the King ſeized the Goal for ever. Theſe two are cited by my Lord <hi>Coke 2 Inſt. 43.</hi> And in Sir <hi>George Reynel</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>9 Report, Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herberts Abridgment, Titl' coron' placit' 233.</hi> A Layman was taken in a Robbery, the Ordinary challenges him as a Clerk, whereas he was a Layman: It was ruled, that for his falſe challenge the Ordinary ſhould loſe his Temporalities to the King, and loſe his Franchiſe to challenge Clerks for him and his Succeſſors for ever. Thus far is plain, That Franchiſes, if miſuſed, are forfeited; and that though enjoyed by Perſons in a corporate capacity, as appears by the Caſes put. And then as a Corporation may forfeit any Franchiſe they are ſeized of in right of the Corporation ſo may a Corporation forfeit the Franchiſe of the Corporation it ſelf, upon the ſame ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Law; unleſs any one will ſay, The Franchiſe of being a Corporation cannot be miſuſed; and that would be a very ſtrange matter to aſſert.</p>
            <p>Every Corporation is entruſted with a Franchiſe to make Laws for Governing the Subject within its Iuriſdiction. If that Power be exerciſed to the Subjects prejudice, as it may be, it were an hard matter if there were no Law to redreſs that Grievance. Suppoſe a Corporation under their common Seal ſhould authoriſe a Rebellion, would any Man ſay that were no forfeiture? 'Tis ſaid indeed by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103424:8"/> 
               <hi>Pigott, 21 Ed. 4. f. 13. Arguendo,</hi> upon a Caſe (where the Queſtion is Whether a Corporation ſhould avoid a Bond entred into by the Mayor by Dureſs) That a Corporation can neither commit Treaſon or Felony; but upon the ſame reaſon that he urges, That a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot act at all, that is, abſtractedly from all the Members of it; for ſo this Notion is, that a Corporation is a Body in conſideration of Law only, and not reality; and therefore the particular Act even of the Head of that Body ſhall affect him perſonally only. But this is only a Notion of his arguing; but it is the beſt opinion of that Book, that Dureſs to the Members did ſo affect the Corporation, that it ſhould avoid the Bond.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, a Corporation may be ſurrendred; and ſurely that that may be ſurrendred, may be forfeited; and I ſhall offer you ſome Authorities in this caſe, <hi>12 E. 3. rot. clauſ. memb. 36.</hi> A Writ is directed to the Conſtable of <hi>Dover,</hi> reciting, That the Cinque-Ports had ſeized divers Goods of ſeveral Merchant Strangers <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> and others, and the Writ commands that Right ſhould be done, or elſe the Franchiſe ſhould be ſeized into the Kings hands, <hi>6 Ed. 2. rot. clauſ.

            </p>
            <p>There is another Caſe that comes further, <hi>Paſch. 9 Ed. 1. Majus rot. 25.</hi> I find it likewiſe among my Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Hales</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections that he has given to <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Library; I took it out of that Book: 'Tis in the Collection of the <hi>Adjudicata</hi> in the time of <hi>Ed. 1. fol. 28. a.</hi> Thus it was: There was the Abbot of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> had made an Agreement with the men of <hi>Sandwick</hi> about paying ten Hogsheads of Wine yearly to the Abbot; and there was due to the Abbot ſome thirty Marks, and he had Iudgment, and Execution went out; and thus 'tis in the Book, <hi>Vic. de— Mandatur quod Levari fac' 30 Marcas de bonis ipſius ad opus Abbatis pro pretio 10 Doleorum Vini annuatim ſolvend'</hi> And they made reſcue when the Sheriff came to execute the Writ, and they were ſued for that, and the Iudgment of the King and his Council, which was by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it was adjourned into Parliament, was <hi>Quod Libertas de Sandwick ſorisfact' ſit.</hi> And there is this Obſervation, tho it be written with the ſame Hand, which is not his, but the Clerks that tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it, <hi>Judicium illud extendit contra Barones 5 Portuum &amp; eorum libertates ut mihi videtur.</hi> Theſe are the Words of that Book: And this will go a great way with the City of <hi>London</hi> as to their confirmation of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> for the Cinque Ports are confirmed by Act of Parliament as well as they.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, there are many Caſes of like nature, and that even in the Caſe of the City of <hi>London</hi> too, as I ſhall ſhew you by and by. Now tho theſe are not Iudgments in <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s to out a Corporation of a Franchiſe of being a Corporation, yet it ſhews that theſe things were forfeitures of all the Franchiſes of a Corporation; for a Seizure is never but where there is matter of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103424:9"/> forfeiture found upon Record, as in Sir <hi>George Reynel</hi>'s Caſe; or to ground a forfeiture, upon which to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> as in our Caſe. But in the Caſe of <hi>9 Ed. 1.</hi> there it does appear Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given by the Parliament, that the Liberty ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, not that it ſhould be ſeized into the Kings hands only.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, where all the Franchiſes of a Corporation are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, what is the Corporation? Truly, 'tis nothing, 'tis but a Name; a Corporation without a Power to act, is nothing at all: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do not find any Iudgment in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> of a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being forfeited, yet, my Lord, it doth not follow from thence that this cannot be by Law; for many <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> have been brought againſt <hi>London,</hi> and other places too, to out Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Franchiſes, but it hath always ended in ſubmiſſion to the King, and ſo they have been at quiet. All the <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> in Mr. Attorney <hi>Palmer</hi>'s time, after the Kings Reſtauration, againſt the ſeveral Corporations, they all ſubmitted; and yet that was to queſtion the very being of their Corporations.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, pray conſider a little upon the Rule of Law: It ſhould ſéem very ſtrange if a Corporation ſhould neglect to come into Eyre, or into the Kings Bench the ſame Term that a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> is brought againſt them, they muſt be outed of their Franchiſe for ever, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>15 Ed. 4. 6, &amp; 7.</hi> And yet, when all the contempts and oppoſitions imaginable are found upon Record that this ſhould not be a forfeiture, that ſeems abſurd that a Neglect in Eyre ſhould do it, but all the Oppreſſions and Offences in the World, when found upon Record, ſhould not do it.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, the miſchiefs that would follow from hence are very great: How many Oppreſſions and Offences would be daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if every Corporation were a Franchiſe and Iurisdiction inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon the Crown? and the puniſhment truly of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men for thoſe Offences, would not be adequate, where the power of offending and miſgoverning ſhould ſtill remain; ſure that were no adequate redreſs of ſuch an inconvenience. And to this purpoſe, my Lord, I ſhall humbly offer a Caſe, and 'tis that great Caſe betwéen the Earls of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford, Hill' 20. Ed. 1. in B. R. rot. Wallie 14.</hi> 'Tis likewiſe in <hi>Riley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamenti 83, 86.</hi> The Caſe is this in ſhort, They both claimed the Liberty of <hi>Returna Brevium,</hi> and they had incurred great contempts in refuſing to obey the Kings Writs, and Iudgment was given againſt them, That the Liberty ſhould be ſeized for this reaſon, which I think will go a great way in this Caſe, and for which I offer it, <hi>Quia puniendus eſt Dominus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis in eo quo deliquit.</hi> I think, my Lord, as I ſaid, that will go a great way in this Caſe, to ſhew the Reaſon of the Law.</p>
            <p>My Lord, If the granting of too many and too large Franchiſes were a miſchief, as certainly it was by Law, and as appears by the Commons Petitions <hi>21 Ed. 3. rot. Parl. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 17.</hi> where they pray, That new and large Franchiſes may not be granted, becauſe it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the overthrowing the Common Law, and great Oppreſſion of the People. And the Kings Anſwer was, That care ſhould be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103424:9"/> taken for the time to come. I ſay then, if this were ſuch a miſchief, that there ought not to be granted new and large Franchiſes, much more would it be a miſchief if theſe Franchiſes ſhould not be under the controul of the Law when they exerciſe ſuch Oppreſſion. And ſo my Lord I ſhall leave that point; for I think it will be pretty clear, that a Corporation may forfeit their being of a Corporation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I ſhall next than conſider, whether the City of <hi>London</hi> be in any other plight than any other Corporations. I think truly there is no difference at all. Now this Queſtion doth depend upon what they have ſet forth by their Plea. And that is the confirmation of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta cap. 9. Civitas London habeat omnes libertates ſuas anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas &amp; conſuetudines ſuas.</hi> And then their Act of <hi>1 E. 3.</hi> upon which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>4 Inſt. 253.</hi> ſays, that the Franchiſe of this City ſhall not for any Cauſe be ſeized into the Kings hands. And then theirs of <hi>7 R. 2.</hi> which ſays, that the City ſhall enjoy its whole Liberties, <hi>Licet uſi vel abuſi.</hi> This is their Foundation upon which they would diſtinguiſh this City from all other Corporations. Now as to theſe things, I give theſe Anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that plainly is no more a confirmation to them than 'tis to other Cities and Corporations. For not only the City of <hi>London</hi> is named to have its ancient liberties and cuſtoms preſerved, but 'tis likewiſe <hi>Omnes aliae Civitat', &amp;c.</hi> And all Cities, Burroughs and Towns, and the Barons of Cinque Ports, and all other Ports, ſhould have all their Liberties and Frée Cuſtoms. So my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> agrées it in his Comment. And in what he cites out of the <hi>Mirror of Juſtice,</hi> and other ancient Authors of our Law, they ſhould enjoy their Franchiſes which they had right to by lawful title of the gift and confirmation of the King, and which they had not forfeited by any abuſe. So that the Act which confirmed them did not purge former forfeitures, much leſs did it licenſe other abuſes.</p>
            <p>Then for their Acts of <hi>1 E. 3.</hi> and <hi>7 R. 2.</hi> I ſhall humbly offer this, That as they are in Truth no Acts of Parliament at all, ſo they will not concern this Queſtion, whatſoever my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. But I ſhall give ſome inſtances before theſe Acts, to ſhew that they never had ſuch an unqueſtionable Power as they now dream of, and then ſome inſtances in after times, that there either were no ſuch Acts, or no ſuch ſenſe at leaſt is to be put upon them as they have ſtrained to make.</p>
            <p>Firſt it appears <hi>15 E. 1.</hi> that the Franchiſe of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was ſeized into the Kings hand, and <hi>Johannes de Britton</hi> was made <hi>Cuſtos Civitatis London,</hi> who was no Freeman; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that the Franchiſe was ſeized into the Kings hands, for they had a power to chooſe <hi>de ſeipſis</hi> by Charter from King <hi>John</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to be a Mayor or chief Governour, but here was another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour appointed them.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Rot' Pat' 26 E. 1. Rex pro bono ſervicio Civit' London' reddit eis Civit' ſuam London habend' dict' Civibus ad volunt' Regis. Teſte Rege.</hi> So that both the City and all its Franchiſes were ſeized at that time; for he reſtored the very City of <hi>London</hi> to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103424:10"/> 
               <hi>habend'</hi> during his Will and Pleaſure. Thus my Lord it ſtood in the time of <hi>E. 1.</hi> Then in the time of <hi>E. 2.</hi> ſeized again; <hi>14 E. 2. memb. 21.</hi> of the Pat' Rolls in <hi>21 Rex dimiſit Civibus London' Officium Major' Civitat' London', 15 E. 2. Rex dedit licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam eligendi Major' London'.</hi> And in the ſecond part of Pat' Rolls <hi>15 E. 2. m. 5.</hi> The King recites, That whereas in the Fourtéenth year of his Reign he had replevyed to them the Office of Mayor <hi>Uſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> quindenam Sancti Martini,</hi> and alſo recites which Office was ſeized into the Kings hands by the Iuſtices of Eyre in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and he was willing to continue it longer to them, <hi>ex gratia ſpeciali</hi> he did grant them the ſaid Office <hi>Quamdiu. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſecond part of Pat' Rolls in <hi>20 E. 2.</hi> it is recited, that the King had ſeized the Office of the Mayoralty, and had replevied it from time to time; and that one <hi>Hamond de Chigwell</hi> was made Mayor, the King had excepted of him for Mayor, <hi>Et Rex volens eis gratiam uberiorem facere,</hi> grants him the Office of Mayor.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, theſe ſeizures ſhew plainly that the Franchiſes of the City were forfeitable; for either they were ſeized upon matter of Record found for a Forfeiture, or elſe upon ſome matter which was to be a ground of a Forfeiture. So then they were abſolutely gon, and I do not find that theſe were ever taken out of the Kings hands by Proceſs of Law, but were reſtored by Grace and Favour; for till the <hi>20 E. 2.</hi> it appears, that they ſo long continued in the Kings hands, and he abſolutely diſpoſed of them.</p>
            <p>Here is now a Favour to them, and a plenary reſtitution. Thus it ſtood in the Reigns of <hi>E. 1.</hi> and <hi>E. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the next thing will be for their Act of <hi>1 E. 3.</hi> which they back with my Lord <hi>Cokes</hi> obſervation upon it, that it was <hi>Authoritate Parliamenti.</hi> Now truly my Lord, there is no ſuch Act of Parliament that is any where extant. For it is not in Print, neither are there any Parliament Rolls of <hi>E. 3's</hi> time till <hi>4 E. 3.</hi> And he that cites it, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, cites no Roll at all for it; ſo that where we ſhall find this Act of Parliament, truly I do not know. But this Act at beſt amounts to no more, than that for any perſonal Treſpaſs of Officers, the Liberties of the City ſhould not be ſeized; but that ſignifies nothing, for that is not our Caſe. There are Acts of the Corporations not of particular Officers; though I cannot but obſerve how the Law was taken to be at that time before this their pretended Act, even for the Offence of private Officers, and that appears to be the Law too in the Caſe of <hi>9 E. 1.</hi> which I cited before, which was only the Offence of the Mayor of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who refuſed to anſwer for a Treſpaſs and a Reſcue, was committed, and the whole Liberty ſeized.</p>
            <p>Now this Act of <hi>1 E. 3.</hi> be it what it will, though they would take it in that ſenſe, that no forfeiture ſhould be incurred for the Treſpaſs of an Officer, yet I find quite the contrary thereunto, and that it hath not prevailed even in that ſenſe. For <hi>5 E. 3. rot. clauſ. 14.</hi> there the King did diſcharge one from the Office of Mayor, and commands the Aldermen and Comminalty to chooſe another. Now this my Lord I take to be not ſo much a puniſhing of the Officer as a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103424:10"/> breaking in upon the Franchiſe it ſelf. But I ſhall ſhew more fully in the Reign of <hi>R. 2.</hi> that this was done.</p>
            <p>Yet I will firſt take notice of the Statute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> which is the next thing that they rely upon; and this, with ſubmiſſion, is no Act of Parliament neither; for though my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>4th Inſt. 205.</hi> ſays, this is the Statute mentioned in our Books, which ſupports the Cuſtoms in <hi>London</hi> to deviſe in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> and other Cuſtoms againſt Acts of Parliament, and cites Authorities in the Margent; yet, my Lord, I have looked, and can find none of them to ſpeak to the purpoſe for which they are cited, but the Book of <hi>7 H. 6. fol. 1.</hi> where the cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> to deviſe in <hi>Mortmain</hi> is in Queſtion, and there it was ruled a good cuſtom, becauſe of the Statute that confirms it after the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> but ſays, that Book <hi>Quere the Statute,</hi> to that they were not well apprized of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in thoſe days, tho this were the foundation of all the reſolutions of that kind.</p>
            <p>It appears by the Roll that it is no Act of Parliament in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, for its <hi>7 R. 2. N. 37.</hi> 'tis a Prayer of the Commons, That there might be a Patent granted to the City, confirming their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Licet uſi vel abuſi fuerint.</hi> And the Anſwer was, <hi>Le Roy le veult;</hi> but this is no Act of Parliament, it is no more than a confirmation of the Letters Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents, which had been <hi>primo R. 2.</hi> Beſides fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there never was any Patent granted in purſuance of this Act: And yet 'tis plain, that if it had been to, it would only have extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Forfeitures that were paſt, but could never amount to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation or Licenſe for the future. And, my Lord, this appears by theſe Authorities and Records that I ſhall now cite. The <hi>1 part of Pat. Rolls. 16 R. 2. Membrano 36, 37.</hi> whereby it fully appears, That notwithſtanding theſe pretended Statutes, there was no ſuch Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the City, but that for the Offences of their Officers or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Franchiſe ſhould be ſeized.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I muſt a little obſerve, that truly the City have attempted to raiſe themſelves above the fear of any Iudgment in any of the Kings Courts; for in <hi>primo R. 2. Parl. Roll 126.</hi> there they Petition for a Confirmation of their Charter, with a Clauſe of <hi>licet non uſi vel abuſi,</hi> which was that they then would have to be done in Parliament for them. But they do likewiſe deſire in their Petition, that notwithſtanding any Statute, Priviledge, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Iudgment made or to be made to the contrary, their Liberties might be confirmed; of this 'tis ſaid the King will adviſe. There is in <hi>1 R. 2. Parliament Rolls 121.</hi> as pleaſant a Petition as the other, they there do deſire, that the interpretation of their Charter may be left to themſelves; and where it is doubting, ſuch meaning as they ſhould put upon it ſhould be allowable. But to that the Kings Anſwer was, That he would make the interpretation of his own Charters according as his Counſel ſhould adviſe. So that I obſerve, they would feign have been abſolute, but they could never do it. It hath always been denied them. So that from what was done at this time and after <hi>7 R. 2.</hi> it does appear plainly, that there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103424:11"/> was no difference between the City of <hi>London</hi> and any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, only this is really the greateſt. But as all greatneſs is the Kings Favour; ſo when men forget their duty in abuſing the Kings Favour, this great Court is the place to put them in mind of it. I come then to the third Queſtion:</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III. Whether the Act of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty in Common Council aſſembled, be an Act of the Corporation, ſo as to make a Forfeiture of the whole?</hi> And with ſubmiſſion my Lord, that will be pretty clear too upon theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Firſt of all, the whole Corporation is fully repreſented by them, notwithſtanding the diſparity of number ſet forth in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Again, All By-laws and Ordinances made for the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order of the City, are certainly the Acts of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; but the ſole power of making thoſe Laws is in the Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council, and therefore ſure the whole power of the Corporation is in the Common Council.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> They have the ſole power of the Corporation-Seal. They can bind all the whole Corporation by any alienation to, or charge upon their Inheritance; and by conſequence they may ſurrender all or any of their Franchiſes, and then as I ſaid, they may forfeit them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> They have pleaded that there hath been time out of mind a Common Council, conſiſting of the Mayor, Aldermen, and two hundred and fifty Citizens, who are called the Commons of the City. So that it ſhall be intended now, that as they have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for it as incident to their Corporation, it was part of their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitution to be thus repreſented by them, and ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their Laws: But there is another reaſon for it, and that is, that it is an inſeparable incident to a Corporation, implyed in Law without grant, that they have a power to make By-Laws to bind the Corporation, without which there were no government in a Corporation; and therefore a miſ-uſer of that power muſt be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Corporation, becauſe 'tis a breach of their Original Truſt: <hi>22 Aſſiſ. pl. 34.</hi> there is this Rule given, and a true one it is, Where there are many Franchiſes granted which do not depend one upon another, there the miſ-uſer of one is a Forfeiture of that one which was miſ-uſed; but where there are ſeveral parts of a Franchiſe depending all upon the ſaid Franchiſe, if any part be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, the entire Franchiſe ſhall be forfeited. As for inſtance, if a man have a Fair, a Court of Pypowders is incident to it, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſer of that Court of Cypowders, is a forfeiture of the whole Fair it ſelf; for where any part is abuſed that is incident to an entire Franchiſe, that abuſe forfeits the whole. And this is the Opinion of <hi>Palmers Reports</hi> in the Caſe of the Corporation of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> where 'tis doubted whether the Market was forfeited for taking too much Toll, becauſe the Toll was not inſeparably incident to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and ſo was not dependant upon the entire Franchiſe, and there the rule is taken as I have ſaid before, that the miſ-uſer of a part of an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103424:11"/> entire Franchiſe, or a power that is incident to it, is a forfeiture of the Franchiſe.</p>
            <p>Then my Lord, if they cannot forfeit here, the whole power of the Truſt of the Corporation is repoſed in them, and may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed by them, to the Oppreſſion of the Kings Subjects, and there is no remedy, if they ſhall not be puniſhed at all. For it is much harder to ſay, that ſeveral Acts of all the particular perſons, ſhould forfeit the Corporation, than that their Ioynt Act ſhould do it. But this my Lord, is an Act contrary to the truſt upon creating the Corporation, and may be a miſ-uſer to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and oppreſſion of all people; and if this ſhould not forfeit the Corporation there is no remedy at all, but the power remains of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing as it did before.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, I think, with ſubmiſſion, I have made it pretty plain; and as they are not diſtinguiſhed from other Corporations in point of priviledge as to forfeitures, ſo this is their Act, and ſhall bind them, being done by their Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> Then the fourth point will be, <hi>Whether theſe Offences ſet forth in the Replication are Forfeitures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The firſt is, the making of that Law in the Common Council for the levying of ſums of mony upon the Kings Subjects, and the actual levying of thoſe ſums accordingly; and this they juſtifie under their preſcription to have reaſonable Tolls, as they ſet forth in their Pleadings, from all Perſons that come to their Markets to ſell Proviſion there, and power to reduce their Tolls to a certainty by an Act of Common Council. This is their Iuſtification; ſo that, my Lord, the firſt thing to be conſidered is,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> What right they have to theſe Tolls or Sums of Mony aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the By-law; and then</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> Whether if they have no right, their taking upon them to make a Law be a Forfeiture?</p>
            <p>For their Right, that depends upon a preſcription to have reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Toll, as they ſet it forth, and this as they have pleaded, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be no Right at all; for a Preſcription to have Toll and Tollage, not ſhewing how much in certain, is void; for reaſonable Toll is not incident to a Market, but the Party has it by the Kings Grant, and ſo 'twas adjudged in this Court, <hi>Mich. 39. &amp; 40. Eliz.</hi> cited by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>Second Inſt. 220.</hi> So if the King grant a Toll, if he do not in his Grant aſcertain how much ſhall be taken for Toll, that Grant is void: And ſo is the Preſcription too, as you may ſée in the Corporation of <hi>Maidenhead</hi> in <hi>Palmer</hi>'s Reports, <hi>fo. 79.</hi> grounded upon <hi>9 H. 6.45. &amp; 11. H. 6. 19.</hi> and ſo he cites the Opinion of <hi>Popham</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Heedy</hi> and <hi>Weeldhouſe,</hi> for no Subject can preſcribe to have Toll, but by the Grant of the King.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, this is not properly a Toll neither, nor in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Toll; for that is always paid by the Buyer, and never paid before a Sale; but here all that comes to the Market, whether they buy or not buy, ſell or not ſell, they muſt pay by this Law.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103424:12"/> My Lord, I confeſs there may be a cuſtom for Perſons to pay for Standings in a Fair or Market, as that Caſe was <hi>9 H. 6. 45.</hi> but yet that muſt be preſcribed for in a certain Sum, which is not done here. And this cuſtomary Payment is in the ſame nature as a Toll tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or a Toll through, which cannot be in an uncertain Sum; for they are all by preſcription, and a Grant of them now uncertain would not be good.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, however, Iudgment upon theſe Pleadings muſt be given againſt the City; for either the Preſcription, as they have ſet it forth, is good, or it is not good; if it be good, then the Traverſe that is taken is well taken, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they have no ſuch Cuſtom, and they ought to have taken iſſue upon that which they have not done; for, my Lord, they have taken iſſue thus, That, time out of mind, they have had reaſonable Toll of all Perſons coming to the Market to ſell their Proviſion, without tying of it to the reaſonable Toll aſſeſſed and reduced to certainty by the Law; and this is naught; for tho they had a reaſonable Toll in general, taking the Preſcription to be good, yet if either that reaſonable Toll in the uſe of it were not taken in that manner, or to that value that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs by their By-law, then have they done wrong; and therefore our traverſe is proper to their reaſonable Toll, that they had not, time out of mind, ſuch a Toll as they ſet forth; for it muſt be ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Toll as may anſwer to that which is aſſeſſed in the By-law, and that they have not put in iſſue. For the King, when once he hath granted a Market, cannot after grant Toll to that Market, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a free Market, and the People have right to come to it as a free Market; neither can they, when once by cuſtom they have exerciſed their Power of aſſeſſing reaſonable Toll, alter that at their pleaſure; for it being once ſet, all People have right to come upon ſuch terms: And if they increaſe the Toll, under pretence to reduce it to certainty, it will be void; for they may lower their Price if they will, but they can never come to increaſe the Penalty. If therefore they have done all in not taking iſſue upon the Traverſe, which does take in the full ſubſtance of their Rejoynder; if it be good, then Iudgmene muſt be given againſt them upon that reaſon; ſo then, my Lord, the Queſtion will be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the making of a Law to raiſe Mony at large upon the Subject be a Forfeiture of the Charter?</hi> And truly, my Lord, that it is. For</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> 'Tis the uſurping of a Power that they neither can have, nor have by Law.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> 'Tis a Breach of the Truſt annexed to the Corporation; for 'tis a Miſuſer of the Franchiſe to the oppreſſion of the Kings Subjects; and therfore the Charter muſt be forfeited, and not the other Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe; not the Franchiſe of a Toll, for they have none; not the Franchiſe of the Market, for that would be nothing. If the Market be forfeited, it muſt either be extinguiſhed or kept; if it be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis a puniſhment to others that did not offend; and if it be kept, the it be forfeited, 'tis no puniſhment to them that do offend: And 'tis a Queſtion whether a Market may be forfeited for taking unreaſonable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103424:12"/> Toll, and that appears in the Caſe of <hi>Maidenhead.</hi> And as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays upon the Statute about taking Outragious Toll, the Franchiſe ſhould be ſeized only till it be redeemed by them.</p>
            <p>But my Lord however, without going far into that matter, this Offence lyes not only in taking the money, but in taking upon them, and uſurping a power to make Laws to raiſe money. They have taken upon them a Legiſlative Power to oppreſs their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is their Offence, and that is a miſ-uſer of their Franchiſe. My Lord, in the Caſe of Ship money, it was not the <hi>Quantum</hi> of money that was raiſed that was complained or quarrelled at, but it was the manner of levying of it without an Act of Parliament. The Logick and Conſequence of that was it which was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and ſtood upon. So here, the abuſe and the offence is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Law, and the conſequence of that; for by the ſame reaſon that they have a Preſcription to lay ſo much, they may have a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to lay ten times as much. So that upon what I offer upon this point, I conceive it ought to amount to a forfeiture of their Charter, and the loſs of their Corporation.</p>
            <p>Then the next thing will be that which is the laſt matter, that is the Petition, and that is of a ſtrange Nature; where the Offence is not only in Preſenting, but in Printing and Diſperſing of it; it charges the King with interrupting the publick Iuſtice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the making the Neceſſary Proviſions for the Security of his Proteſtant Subjects; for, my Lord, to ſay, that the Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parliament, which is the Kings Act, who ſurely has alone, and none but he, the undoubted Prerogative of Calling, Proroguing, and Diſſolving Parliaments; to ſay that Act of his was an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Iuſtice, is all one as to ſay, the King did interrupt: and 'tis done by them as a Corporation; 'tis the Act of the City in their Common Council in the Name of the Corporation; and as we have pleaded it, the Mayor, Citizens and Commonalty in Common Council did do it, which ſure is the Corporation, as they would have it. And that I rely upon for the reaſons I offered before upon that point.</p>
            <p>Then the matter of this Petition is, the taking upon them to cenſure the King and his Government by this Petition. The Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diſperſing it, is now publickly Scandalizing and Libelling the King; for 'tis in the nature of an Appeal to the people: 'tis unlawful to Print any mans private Caſe, while it is depending in any Court of Iudicature before it comes to Iudgment, becauſe 'tis an Appeal to the people. And that was my Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Hales</hi> Opinion in <hi>Colonel Kings Caſe.</hi> And the ill conſequences of ſuch proceedings are ſo many, and the danger ſo evident in theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious days, that I do not know indeed whether it may tend.</p>
            <p>The fact is confeſſed by them in their Rejoynder, but they ſay they did it to alleviate mens fears, and quiet their minds <hi>abſ<expan>

                  </expan> hoc,</hi> that they did it <hi>aliter vel alio modo.</hi> Surely my Lord this is no ſort of excuſe in the world, nor is it capable of any. They have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103424:13"/> owned the thing, but they have excuſed it in the manner of doing thereof. And I may venture to ſay the Traverſe is impertinent: Suppoſe a Man be Indicted for publiſhing a Libel, and the owns the Fact, but doth traverſe <hi>abſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> hoc,</hi> that he did it <hi>malitioſe,</hi> or with an intent to defame, that ſurely would be an idle thing; for thoſe are conſtructions that the Law puts upon it, and are not matters tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable, or to be put in iſſue. But if the Fact be done, the Law ſays 'tis maliciouſly done, and with ſuch an intention. Therefore a confeſſion of the Fact is a confeſſion of all the conſequences that the Law puts upon the Fact.</p>
            <p>My Lord, this can amount to no leſs than the forfeiture of their Charter, not only for the greatneſs of the Offence, but becauſe otherwiſe the Law would be unequal; for if this were the Caſe of a private common Perſon, he muſt be fined and impriſoned during the Kings pleaſure, as was the Caſe of <hi>Harriſon</hi> in <hi>I.Cr. 503.</hi> for words ſpoken of Iuſtice <hi>Hutton.</hi> Now, my Lord, a Corporation is not capable of ſuffering this Impriſonment, and therefore 'tis a much greater Offence in them, as the Body is greater than any particular Member: And then, that which is a greater Offence would have a leſs Puniſhment if the Charter it ſelf were not forfeited, than it would if a particular Perſon were puniſhed. And give me leave to apply here the Reaſon of the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s Caſe, that I cited before, <hi>Quia Dominus Libertatis puniretur in eo quo deliquit.</hi> So they ſhall loſe their Charter for the abuſe of that Power that was entruſted with them by their Charter. Therefore upon the whole matter, I do humbly pray your Iudgment for the King, that they may be outed of their Franchiſe of being a Corporation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Nature of a Corporation in its Exiſtence, Powers and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>A Body Politick or Corporation is created by the Policy of Man, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 2. The Perſons Incorporate are created a Body, and are of capacity to take or grant, do, or act, according to the Powers and Authorities in their Creations given them, and to no other purpoſe, only a Capacity, and not properly a Franchiſe.</p>

            <p>2 <hi>Bulſtrode</hi> 233. The Body is inviſible, therefore cannot appear in Perſon.</p>
            <p>Diſſolution of a Corporation there may be: As where the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons incorporated all dye, Corporation of neceſſity is thereby diſſolv'd.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 13. <hi>b.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rolls Ab.</hi> 1. 514.</p>
            <p>But no Book or Caſe mentions Diſſolution by Forfeiture.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>H. 8.</hi> when the Corporation of Monks, Nuns, and other Religious Houſes were diſſolv'd,</p>
            <p>Had it not béen a very eaſie way, if this Doctrin of diſſolving by Forfeiture would have done it, thereby to have effected the Kings purpoſe?</p>
            <p>It was but to have iſſued out a Commiſſion, and thereby find but one illegal Act or Miſcarriage done by the Corporation, and thereby the Corporation diſſolved.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, or afterwards, the Surrenders made by Corporations was of their Lands, not of their Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Bodies Politique, as appears</p>

            </p>
            <p>For tho they ſurrendred their Church, and all their Poſſeſſions and Franchiſes, yet the Corporation remain'd, not thereby diſſolv'd.</p>

            <p>And therefore to this time, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 <hi>Car. I.</hi> when theſe Caſes were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and argued, the Law was taken to be, that a Corporation could not be diſſolved by Surrender.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:103424:14"/>
            <p>And the Statute <hi>27 H. 8. 31 H. 8. 34 H. 8.</hi> for diſſolving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, none of them mention Surrender of the Corporations.</p>
            <p>And the the word Forfeiture be in thoſe Statutes, thereby is not meant forfeiture of Corporation, but forfeiture of the Lands of the Abbots by Attainder, <hi>viz.</hi> Abbots of <hi>Glaſſenbury, Colcheſter,</hi> and others, attabited upon the matter of the Kings Supremacy.</p>
            <p>And ſo it appears, <hi>Rolls 2 Rep. 101.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be admitted, That a Corporation may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and thereby extinct and deſtroyed, it is no conſequence that they may be forfeited.</p>
            <p>For there are many things ſurrenderable that are not forfeitable: As Annuities granted <hi>pro Concilio impenſo &amp; impendendo,</hi> which are perſnal Intereſts, and ſo fixed to the Perſon, as not transferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Grant, Forfeiture, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Much more then of a Corporation, which is far from being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or forfeitable; it is the very Capacity or Exiſtence, and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in its Nature from the Perſons incorporated.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In a Caſe of great Authority, and upon a Writ of Error out of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon a Iudgment in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the Corporation of <hi>Dublin,</hi> a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt <hi>Cuſack</hi> and others, Aldermen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who pretended to have Priviledges, and a Guild, and to be a Corporation; and this, I preſume, is for their being a Corporation; for there is a <hi>Cur' adviſare vult</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, and ſo 'tis not put in the Caſe; but 'tis alſo brought for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Liberties that they did pretend to claim, that they only, and no others, ſhould ſell and buy all Merchandizes there, and no body ſhould buy of another, or ſell to another, but to them; that all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize ſhould be brought to their Common Hall there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as to thoſe Liberties, they are forejudged, that the Liberties ſhould be ſeized, and they outed: As to their claiming the Corporation, there is a <hi>Cur' adviſare vult,</hi> ſo the Caſe is in <hi>Palmer;</hi> but in the other Book, <hi>Rolls</hi> 115. there 'tis agreed, If a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> be brought to diſſolve a Corporation, it ought to be brought againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons; for the Writ ſuppoſes that they are not a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 'tis to falſifie the Suppoſal of the Writ? to name them as a Corporation. Now here this Writ ſuppoſes them to be a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103424:14"/> or elſe they could not be Defendants, and then it comes and falſifies that ſuppoſal, by aſſigning that they are no Corporation, nor ever were; or if they had, they have forfeited it; and ſo all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that this Writ ſtands upon is deſtroyed. My Lord, in this Caſe of <hi>Cuſack</hi> I am aſſiſted further with a Report of it in my Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Hale</hi>'s Book; a Report of very great Authority with all Men of our Profeſſion, and there he ſays expreſly, If a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> be brought for the Vſurping of a Corporation, it muſt be brought againſt particular Perſons, becauſe it goes in diſaffirmance of the Corporation, and Iudgment ſhall be given, that they be outed of the Corporation; but if it be for Liberties that are claimed by a Corporation, it muſt be brought againſt them as a Corporation.</p>
            <p>'Tis in my Lord <hi>Hales</hi> Common Place Book, which is in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Library, <hi>fo. 168. placito 7.</hi> My Lord, this is our very caſe; if you go about to ſay our Corporation is forfeited, or muſt be diſſolved; nay more, you ſay it has either never béen, or by forfeiture it is loſt ſo long ago, then here is nothing can come before the Court. This Information is brought in diſ-affirmance of the being of the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore there muſt be ſet up ſome body capable of being a Defendant in ſuch a Suit, and that is, particular Perſons, which ought to have béen named, as was in that Caſe of <hi>Cuſack:</hi> For as the Iudgment of Ouſter of particular Liberties given againſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons will not bind the Body of the Corporation; ſo the Iudgment of not being a Corporation will not be good to charge or oblige particular Perſons, unleſs it be given againſt particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that uſurp the Corporation. The Individual Fréemen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> cannot poſſibly be bound by this Iudgment; for they are not here before you, nor were they ever ſued: For it is the Corporation that is here made Defendant; and I do not conſider the number that make up that Body, that <hi>London</hi>'s being populous alters the caſe; for the caſe is the ſame if it were the Corporation of <hi>Quinborough,</hi> or any other petit Corporation. Suppoſe <hi>20</hi> Men be a Corporation, or pretend to be a Corporation, and you come to enquire by what particular means theſe Men pretend to be a Corporation, or as the words of this <hi>Quo Wartanto</hi> are, uſurp to be a Corporation, you muſt not ſay, that they are one, and then ſay they uſurp it; for 'tis not the Corporation that uſurps to be a Corporation, that is impoſſible, but 'tis the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons that uſurp to be the Corporation, when indéed they are none. A Corporation may uſurp a Market, or they may uſurp a Leet, but they cannot uſurp themſelves.</p>
            <p>It appears, my Lord, in Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi>'s Book of printed Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, a laborious thing it is, and wherein he hath collected all the Preſidents he could méet with of <hi>Quo Warranto's,</hi> and there is but one in all that Collection that was brought againſt any Perſons upon the ſcore of their being a Corporation: And what is that? how was it brought? not againſt the Corporation that was, but againſt the Corporation that never was, that is to ſay, a parcel of People that took upon themſelves to be a Corporation, when indéed they were not, and that is but one ſingle Preſident neither. In <hi>Coke</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103424:15"/> 
               <hi>Entries, 527. Tit. Quo Warranto,</hi> the King againſt <hi>Helden</hi> and other Burgeſſes of <hi>Helmeſly</hi> for uſurping to be a Corporation, by the name of the Burgeſſes of <hi>Helmeſly:</hi> How does the Attorney General there bring his Writ? he brings it againſt particular Perſons. My Lord <hi>Hobart,</hi> who was then Attorney General, never thought he could have maintained his <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> or expected Iudgment againſt them, if he had brought it againſt the Burgeſſes of <hi>Helmeſly</hi> generally, and then have ſaid, that they were no Corporation; but he brings it againſt thoſe particular Perſons, and thereupon they come in and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their being ſuch a Corporation, and the having the other Liberties; and the Iudgment is, That of thoſe Liberties thoſe particular Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ouſted, and ſhould not intermeddle with them.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, what Iudgment can be given in this Caſe, that the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens ſhall not intermeddle with the being of Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens? 'Tis a very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Iudgment that <hi>Helden</hi> and thoſe particular Perſons ſhould not intermeddle with ſuch a Liberty, or be in ſuch a Corporation; but if ſuch a Iudgment he given againſt the City here, that would be as much as to ſay, That you have never béen what you are, or you ſhall never be what you are, that is the Engliſh of it.</p>
            <p>And, my Lord, I am ſure as there never was but one <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> that we can find any printed Preſident of againſt the being of a Corporation, ſo that very Preſident is not againſt thoſe that really were ſo, but particular Perſons that uſurped to be ſo. And if you ſearch all the Records of this Kingdom, and all the Books in all the Offices, you will never find any that is brought againſt a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for being a Corporation, upon pretence that they might be made none by a Forfeiture; and no Prerogative of the King ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuſe this, but his Action ſhall abate, if it be not right brought, as well as the Subjects, and ſo is <hi>Plow'd Com. fol. 85.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, my Lord, I have another Authority in this point, and that is in the Caſe of the Corporation of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> which hath béen ſo often cited by Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> and it is in <hi>Palmer, 80, 81.</hi> where 'tis ſaid, When the Attorney General hath ſuppoſed them to be a Corporation, it is not uſual to plead them to be a Corporation; otherwiſe if he had queſtioned them as Inhabitants of ſuch a Town, then they ought to enable themſelves: Thoſe are the words of that Book: And what can be more plain? Here the Attorney General ſuppoſes us to he a Corporation, his Replication flies in his own Face; and he having ſuppoſed it at firſt, he is bound not to queſtion us for our being a Corporation at any time after. As to the buſineſs of <hi>forisfecerunt,</hi> 'tis a ſtrange and a new word that never came into any <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> before, that I know of; but we will accept the new word, but not the thing, and that they have forfeited by ſuch and ſuch Acts; this ſure will be very hard upon us; for if it be a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it muſt relate to the time of the thing done, to the time of the making the Act of the Common Council, to the time of the Toll levyed, or to the time of the Petition; and if it do ſo, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late like a Forfeiture for Treaſon; it muſt reach all mean Acts,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103424:15"/> all the Leaſes that we have made ſince are gone; all the Iudgments that we have given in any Cauſe are <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi> and void; all the Acts of the Corporation are overturned by this forfeiture, and we have béen under a vaſt miſtake all this while. We have had no Mayors nor Sheriffs, no kind of Officers, no manner of regular and legal procéedings; but we have béen under a great miſtake ever ſince this money was ordained or levyed. We have forfeited all; and that it is ſo, is plain, becauſe in all <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> wherein perſons are convicted for uſurping of Liberties, there is a Fine ſet upon them for continuing that Vſurpation, and reaſon good; then if it be an Offence for continuing the liberty, we muſt be fined for doing it ever ſince the Forfeiture, when if Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi>'s Rule be right, there has béen no ſuch Corporation; but we ought to have diſcontinued all our acting as a Corporation, and laid it down, and ſo every ſtep that we have taken ſince hath béen irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and every Act void.</p>
            <p>If ſo be an Action be brought againſt Baron and Feme, and the Plaintiff ſhould in his Replication ſay, they were divorced ſeveral years before, has he not undone all his pleading? Here then is our Caſe, Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> admits us to be ſueable, and yet charges us to have no capacity to be ſued. I do implead you, but you have no right to be impleaded; here he brings us into Court, and when he has brought us here, he quarrels with us for being here; he makes us Defendants, and then queſtions whether we ought to be ſo; and ſo his great Charge againſt us is, that we are what he would have us to be, and what he hath made us to be; for if a Month before the Information, the Corporation was not, but the very being of the Corporation was uſurped, how come we at the Months end to be Defendants? Here comes a new creation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in that time, and makes us parties ſueable in the Court, when by the Charge in the Information we were not ſo a Month before.</p>
            <p>And then my Lord the Information is not quite ſo had, but the Replication is worſe; firſt he takes Iſſue that we never were a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration at all; and the next thing is, if ever you were a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you have ceaſed ſo to be, becauſe you have forfeited it ſo and ſo ſeveral years ago. This is juſt then to put a common Caſe (and I confeſs a very familiar one it is) If I ſhould being an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt a man, and when he hath pleaded, I ſhould by way of Replication ſet forth, there never was any ſuch man as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and take Iſſue upon it; or if there were, that he was dead Ten years ago: And yet this is the ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>Attorneys</hi> Iſſue, and his Replication.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the Authorities before cited in <hi>Palmer, Cokes Entries, Rolls,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Hales Common-place-book,</hi> are not all; for I have ſome other that never ſaw the light in Print yet, and that is the Caſe of the King againſt <hi>Bradwell</hi> and others, <hi>Trin. 18.</hi> of this King. A <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt them for uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a Corporation, or Company of Muſitians; it had been
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103424:16"/> a ſtrange thing if the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> had been brought againſt that Corporation, and then the <hi>Attorney General</hi> had ſaid they were no Corporation, nor never were; there they did think beſt and fitteſt to go againſt <hi>Bradwell,</hi> and the reſt, and that by name and only ſo, not againſt the Body Corporate. So in that Caſe of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which was lately tryed before your Lordſhip in this Court; When the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt ſuch men for uſurping to be all Aldermen and Common Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if the <hi>Attorney General</hi> had once called them Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-men, it had béen a great repugnancy for him afterwards to ſay that they were none, or if they were, that that priviledge of theirs was loſt ſo long ago. So in the Caſe of the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the <hi>Bermudas Company;</hi> it was againſt a Corporation, and againſt particular perſons by name both. Theſe things have béen conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doubtleſs they have gone on in an ordinary way. I muſt confeſs, I was not privy to that particular Caſe, but by the Report of that Caſe, which I have ſeen, I have been informed that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration never appeared; for they ſaid, 'tis not ſenſe for us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for it being a Queſtion by what Warrant we are a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is not the ſuppoſing us a Corporation that do uſurp, but the particular perſons that do uſurp, if it be at all uſurped. Now my Lord if that had been a regular Suit, no doubt but there would have béen Iudgment againſt the Corporation, which there was not. And certainly the Replication of Forfeitures was not good againſt the Corporation, but againſt the particular perſons only.</p>

Shall Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> be admitted to deny the ſuppoſal of his own Writ? and truly I think I might very well leave this part of the Caſe, and this point, to Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> himſelf; for if he will have any thing to be anſwered by us, he muſt maintain us to be a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration capable of anſwering; and ſo I have reaſon to expect that againſt his own Replication he will be pleaſed to ſupport the being of our Corporation, and ſo diſmiſs as hence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> My Lord, I have done with this Point, and now I come to the Replication, which indéed is a kind of a new <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> for it brings in new matter, and therein they do charge two Forfeitures, the one is by reaſon of the abuſe of the Market, the other is by reaſon of the Petition: My Lord, I ſhall anſwer both of them, That we were ſeized of the Market, that is pleaded and that is agréed: That we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103424:16"/> were ſeized of Tolls, and were to have reaſonable Tolls, that is agréed too; that there is a cuſtom in <hi>London</hi> to have Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and that this was by Common Council is agreed; all this is agréed by the Demurrer; that this Toll (though by the way I muſt confeſs, and will agrée with Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> that it is not properly to be called a Toll; for a Toll is only for Goods ſold; and when they are ſold, in recompenſe for the Officers attendance for the teſtification of the Contracts, and the entring them in their Books. But I agrée, this is not ſuch a Duty for Goods bought and ſold, but it) is for the accomodation of Perſons repairing thereunto for their Stalls; and if I would call it by any particular Word, I had rather call it Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage than any thing elſe: It is for thoſe Accomodations which we have béen at vaſt charge in preparing and providing, and for the maintenance of requiſite Officers, and for the cleanſing of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. Now Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> objects, That we cannot preſcribe for a Toll uncertain, and he cites the Caſe of Murage, and the like; and ſo I muſt confeſs, where Murage is granted, 'tis commonly a thing certain, ſo is Pontage, and the like; but I believe (if I had thought that it would have béen a point inſiſted upon) I could have brought you Inſtances where Murage, and ſuch like things, have béen granted in general, and they would have béen ancient ones indéed: And there is a neceſſity for it in ſome caſes; for when a Town will repair its Walls, the charge may be greater or leſs, as the particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents may be, and ſo perhaps a certain Duty would not do it. When a Wall is to be built, there the Duty may be certain; but when it is built, to kéep it in Repair, the Duty of Murage may be uncertain, according to the charge; and if the caſe be not ſo, it will come little to our purpoſe, which is a Duty upon a great and a continuing charge. I will name him ſome things that he muſt agrée, and I know he will grant, are uncertain, as Pickage and Stallage, which are Duties for picking in my Earth to dig holes for the Poſts of Stalls to be fixed in: now there can never be, nor ever was any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing in thoſe matters, for circumſtances in every of thoſe caſes muſt govern it. If I have occaſion for my Stall to uſe a foot of ground, one ſort of Sum is neceſſary; if ten feet, another Sum; it ought to be equal indéed, but it could never be good if it were limited to a Sum certain; and in all grants that ever were of Pickage and Stallage, they were never reduced to a certainty, and thoſe are things too that relate to a Market.</p>
            <p>And ſo I take it to be for Keyage, Anchorage, and the like; for when there are Poſts or Places for Ships, to which they may be fixed, the Owner of the Port may have a compenſation for that, but that muſt néeds be uncertain, according to the circumſtances; if a Ship be bigger or leſſer, if a Ship ſtay a Month or a Day, 'tis not fit the ſame rate ſhould be paid, nor is it uſually granted by particular words, <hi>Co. Ent'</hi> 535 <hi>&amp;</hi> 526. <hi>placit'</hi> 4. The King againſt the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the Water-Bailage, and other things. They pleaded only a Right in general, and do not ſay what the Particulars were; and yet one of the things demanded in the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> was, as I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103424:17"/> ſaid, the Water-Bailage, which ſure if any thing ought to be certain, that ought. In that Caſe it was good Pleading, though I think I could ſay more againſt it, than this thing that is in the nature of Stallage; ſo that all that Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> hath built upon that muſt, I think, néeds vaniſh.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I do not think but <hi>London</hi> ought to be, and is as much under the obedience and correction of the King, as any City; but yet I believe in theſe Caſes of their Cuſtoms, you will give that allowance and indulgence to it that all your Predeceſſors have done, which is greater than they have given to any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in the Kingdom, and that becauſe it was <hi>London;</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch a thing as a Foreign Attachment, I think is hardly allowed in other places; I am ſure I have known it deny'd in ſome, that a Contract in Writing ſhould be equal to a Book Debt; that a Feme Merchant ſhould ſue or be ſued without her Husband; or if he be named, he ſhould be only named for conformity: You take notice that <hi>London</hi> is a Port-Town, and that Men that Trade there, ſometimes go beyond Seas, and in their abſence their Wives trade by themſelves, and perhaps carry on diſtinct Trades while they are here: And ſo they may do in other places may be, but only for the ſake of <hi>London</hi> do you take notice of theſe things there and not elſewhere; their Penalties that are ſued for in their Courts, a great many of them are ſuch as would not be well maintained in other Courts, or in any other place, and yet they are maintained there, as namely, That their Penalties ſhould be ſued for before the Mayor and Aldermen, when the benefit of them goes to their uſe; and yet that is allowed in the Eighth Report, notwithſtanding the grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That they are in ſome ſort Iudges and Parties, <hi>Rolls 2 p. Abr. Tit. Preſcription Letter H. fol. 266. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. &amp; 3.</hi> The City of <hi>London</hi> may preſcribe to have a Court of Chancery in <hi>London</hi> of matters tryed in the Sheriffs Court, though ſuch a Court cannot be granted by the Kings Letters Patents; but the Mayor and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>York</hi> cannot preſcribe for ſuch a Court, becauſe it were very dangerous that ſuch petty Corporations ſhould have ſuch Courts. And whatſoever is ſaid by my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> in his Reports <hi>63.</hi> I do affirm there is no Act of Parliament that erects a Court of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>London,</hi> or the Cinque-Ports; if Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> had ſtrugled with me about the being, or not being of that Act of Parliament, I would have agréed with him that there was no ſuch, ſooner than ſome that he ſays are none. The Cuſtoms of <hi>London</hi> have béen upheld; and I muſt confeſs I think that is very ſtrange, even againſt the general Words of an Act of Parliament, <hi>2 Inſt. 20.</hi> A Goaler in <hi>London</hi> may permit his Priſoner, that is in Execution, to go at large with a Battoon in any place within their Iuriſdiction, and 'tis no eſcape. And ſo is <hi>Plowdens Com. 36.</hi> A Citizen of <hi>London</hi> may ſet up one Retail Trade, though he was bred to another, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Stat. <hi>5<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</hi> of the Quéen. And for a General Rule take that that is ſaid in <hi>Palmer 542.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>London</hi> may preſcribe againſt a Statute, and the reaſon is, becauſe their Liberties are confirmed by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103424:17"/> Statute, and other Towns are not. In <hi>Rolls Rep. 1 p. 105. Sprike</hi> againſt <hi>Tenant,</hi> my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> being then Chief Iuſtice, ſays, We take notice of the Cuſtoms in our Courts, and other Courts in <hi>Weſt-minſter-Hall,</hi> and in <hi>London. Fleetwood</hi> Recorder of <hi>London</hi> ſays a very ſtrange thing in <hi>1 Leon' 284. Hollinſhead</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> Caſe, and in <hi>4 Leon' 182.</hi> That the King's Courts ought to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that thoſe of <hi>London</hi> have a Court of Record; for if a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> iſſues to the Iuſtices in Eyre, it does not belong to them of <hi>London</hi> to claim their Liberties, for all the Kings Courts have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. And truly I have béen enformed, I mean by Copies of Records, that when the Iuſtices in Eyre came to the Tower, this was a Priviledg allowed to them, they were not bound to ſet forth their Liberties as others were.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I think this, as 'tis pleaded, is a Duty very juſtifiable, and very well payable, by vertue of this Cuſtom. I do agrée, as I ſaid, a Toll is properly for Goods ſold, and this is a Cuſtom for the accommodation of thoſe that brought Goods to be ſold, and 'tis like that <hi>1 Leonard 218.</hi> my <hi>Lord Cobhams Caſe,</hi> a Duty paid for the ſtanding in the Cellar, and there that is held to be good. In <hi>Rolls 2 p.</hi> of the <hi>Abridgment 123. Letter B. Hickman's Caſe.</hi> The Lord of a Mannor may preſcribe to have the eighth part of a Buſhel of Corn in four Buſhels that are brought to the Market within the Mannor in the name of the Toll, and that is for Stallage only, for it is ſaid there, whether it be fold or not. And in the ſame Book, <hi>fol. 265.</hi> the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> ſet forth, that they are owners of the Port of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that they maintained Perches in the ſaid River, to direct the Ships in the déep Channel, and that they kept the Key and the Crane, and therefore in conſideration of that, they preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and demanded three pence in the Pound for all Merchandizes in the ſaid Port, and it was held good. Now I agrée Toll-through that can't be preſcribed for ſimply and generally, but by Toll-through I mean as you know, for paſſing and re-paſſing through only, and not for ſtaying; but yet even that may be preſcribed for too, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of repairing a great High-way, or a very foul way, or maintaining a Bridge, and the like. And therefore if our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations here be as good, as that we maintaining thoſe great places may preſcribe for this duty, as for paſſing through the Streets, though it were no Market.</p>
            <p>There is a famous Caſe reported in <hi>Rolls 1 p. fol. 1. &amp; 44.</hi> And 'tis in <hi>2 Bulſtrode,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Moor,</hi> it was the Caſe of the Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Litchfield:</hi> A Preſcription is made, that the Corporation of <hi>Litchfield</hi> hath a Market, and they ought to repair the way to it, and to appoint a Bellman that ſhould ſweep the Market-place, and that for this the ſaid Bellman, time out of mind, had taken of thoſe that brought Corn to the ſaid Market, and opened their Sacks to ſell a pint of Corn, if but a Buſhel or under, if more a Quart. So that if it were opened and not ſold, yet he was to have that Duty, and that Preſcription was adjudged to them by all the Iudges, and yet it does not appear there, whether the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103424:18"/> that way coſt them <hi>5 s.</hi> or <hi>5000 l.</hi> and yet by intendment they would not account it unreaſonable, though it might have been urged it was very unequal; if they could take a Pint for that which was under a Buſhel, perhaps they would take by that means, half of what the party bought; but if there were fifteen Buſhels they had but a Quart, and this was objected as to the inequality of it; and yet they all paſſed over that by a reaſonable intendment, and would not deny the Preſcription to be good. And the Caſe of Cranage in <hi>Dyer,</hi> and the Caſe of <hi>21 H. 7. 16.</hi> are admitted to be good Law, where the Town of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> preſcribed for a Toll of Boats paſſing by the River near the Town.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord for ours, there was very great reaſon to induce it, the great alterations that were made in <hi>London</hi> by the Fire; and it was not the firſt time that <hi>London</hi> was burnt: And if there ſhould be War, and ſo great Alterations and Confuſions, there were great cauſe that the City, that lays out great Sums, and muſt be at ſuch a publick Charge, ſhould not be loſers by it.</p>
            <p>And we do ſet forth more than they do in the Caſe of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> that we provided the Market-places at our own charge; and if they will uſe them, they muſt expect to pay ſome compenſation for it; that we do kéep Officers, and pay them for cleanſing and kéeping Order in the Markets: And above all that, we provide Standings and Stalls, and ſuch Accomodations, and that I am ſure is a Proviſion no Lord of a Market is bound to make unleſs he will, and therefore the Market-people that are accomodated by it have great reaſon to pay for it; and we pay all the Taxes for the Market-places, for the ground is ours; and that is not alledged in the Pleading indéed, but it muſt be implied, becauſe we pay the Taxes, and they that have the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not lyable to pay the Taxes: And ſo is the Iudgment in <hi>Rolls, 2 p. 238.</hi> and the <hi>2d Abr. 289.</hi> And in the Caſe of <hi>Cuſack</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Dodderidge</hi> ſays, That the redéeming of one Fair from the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> coſt the City of <hi>London 8000 l.</hi> for he had a Fair at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and a Market for <hi>40</hi> days, and that during that time no Sale ſhould be in <hi>London,</hi> or the places adjacent, and a great Rate it was if it were ſo. The meaſure of a Toll is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Lord <hi>Coke 2 Inſt. 58.</hi> when the thing demanded for Wares or Merchandizes does ſo burthen the Commodity, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant cannot have a convenient Gain by Trading therewith; and thereby Trave is loſt or hindred, then 'tis an evil Toll. But here indeed the Market-people are better accommodated than ever they were; and Trade is ſo far from being diſcouraged, as that it is increaſed, as is implyed in the Replication; for 'tis ſaid, we receive <hi>5000 l.</hi> a year, which if it were ſo unequal, would not certainly be paid, nor could be, if there were not great Trade there. So that the increaſe of Trade is the thing complained of in this <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto.</hi> And the truth of it is, I have examined and looked into the Fact of theſe things, and there is nothing in this By-law, but what was really anciently paid, except only in one Inſtance, whether
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103424:18"/> it were <hi>6 d.</hi> or no, that was paid when a Cart was drawn by two Horſes, which now is but <hi>4 d.</hi> and if we have increaſed the Toll, which I doubt whether it be ſo or no, 'tis only in a very trifle.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, this Caſe I think is a ſtronger Caſe than that in <hi>5 Rep.</hi> the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London's Caſe,</hi> there is no conſideration of Stalls, or cleanſing the place, but only they had an Officer to ſearch and view, and that was a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of their own; they could not preſcribe for it, but it was thought a penny was a reaſonable recompence, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had a benefit by it; and if he would bring his Cloth to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to be ſold, he ſhould come thither to have it viewed, and give a recompence for it. Now <hi>London</hi> is all Market indeed, every Shop is a Market; and it hath been well ſaid of the Iudges ſeveral times in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> that <hi>London</hi> is the Market of all <hi>England,</hi> and there is never an Acre in <hi>England</hi> but is the better for that.</p>
            <p>As to the Impoſition upon Coals, that is but an inducement, and an inducement is never to be relyed upon; 'tis not to be ſtood upon. And <hi>Mr. Solicitor</hi> did very honourably decline it, and did not make any thing of it, nor trouble the Caſe with it.</p>
            <p>When the City did make this Act of Common Council, they did conſult with their Counſel for matter of Law, and with their Officers and Fellow-Citizens for matter of Fact, and did adjuſt theſe rates, and enacted them to be paid, they being reaſonable ones, and according to the ancient Vſage; but if they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, it will be no cauſe for you to give Iudgment againſt them for many other reaſons; As firſt, you cannot judge this to be unreaſonable. I have not heard one word ſaid that this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable oppreſſive Toll. Here is money levyed, what then? If it be a reaſonable ſum, 'tis not ſo great, it does not deſerve the name of Oppreſſion. I ſay 'tis not ſo great an Oppreſſion, if they ſhould have been miſtaken in the form of inſtituting the levying of it, if they might have done it under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seal, and now they have done it without that by Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council. Nay, it does not deſerve that you ſhould judge it unreaſonable; you cannot do it here, for the conſiderations are meritorious and equivalent to it, the great charge they were at in Building, and they ſtill daily are at in cleanſing and repairing and providing Stalls. But however, the Caſe is not ſo diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here, that you can judicially determine this to be an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Toll. According to the Rule in <hi>Cokes Magna Charta 222.</hi> the Toll of a Market need not be certain, only it muſt be reaſonable. And what ſhall be deemed reaſonable, the Iudges muſt determine if it come judicially before them. So ſhall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Cuſtoms, and reaſonable Fines, and reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and reaſonable Time to remove Goods, and the like, they muſt be judged by the diſcretion of the Iuſtices upon the true
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103424:19"/> ſtate of the Caſe before them. Now this Caſe muſt have all its Circumſtances ſtated and agréed by Demurrer, or found by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. And ſo is <hi>4 Rep. 27. b.</hi> and <hi>Hobart 135.</hi> and <hi>174.</hi> as in the Caſe of Copyholders Fines, the quality and yearly value of the Land muſt appear, or elſe there cannot be Iudgment whether it be reaſonable or no. In the <hi>13th Report fol. 3. &amp; Croke Car. 196.</hi> where the Queſtion was, Whether the Lord of a Mannor might aſſeſs two years and an half value of Copyhold Lands, according to the Rack-Rents for a Fine upon Surrender and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, and upon non-payment to enter for the Forfeiture; as ſuppoſe Land, it be rented at <hi>20 l.</hi> a year, here is <hi>50 l.</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for admittance; there it appeared judicially that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and ſo it was adjudged, becauſe the value was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But who can here ſay, whether the providing of Markets coſt <hi>5 s.</hi> or <hi>500 l.</hi> it is that eſtimable. Perhaps we have over-bought all theſe Tolls that they call unreaſonable; we over it to be reaſonable, the Demurrer agrees it to be ſo, and you muſt intend it to be ſo, unleſs the contrary be ſet forth clearly in its circumſtances; for he that will have a Forfeiture, muſt ſhew the circumſtances to make it out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Another thing is this, to anſwer <hi>Mr. Solicitor</hi> in that point, I ſay, an unreaſonable By-law is no reaſonable cauſe or colour for forfeiting a Corporation, admitting it to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, though I grant it not. My <hi>Lord Hobart</hi> in <hi>Norris &amp; Staps Caſe, Hob. 211.</hi> ſays, that though power to make Laws is given by ſpecial Clauſes in all Incorporations, yet it is needleſs; for that is included by Law in the very Act of Incorporating. For as reaſon is given for the natural Body for the governing of it, ſo Bodies Corporate muſt have Laws as a Politick Reaſon to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them. Reaſon is a faculty in them as 'tis in a man, and may err; and therefore ſays he, if the King do grant Letters Patents of Incorporation to perſons, and he doth thereby make Ordinances and By-laws himſelf, they are ſubject to the ſame conſtruction and rule of Law, as if they were made afterwards by the Corporation. For the King can no more make an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable By-law than a Corporation; but if the King do, ſhall that affect the Corporation, and make the Corporation void by way of repugnancy, or an inſtantaneous breach of Condition? no it ſhall not. And therefore as they may receive unreaſonable Rules from the King, without defeating of the Corporation, or having their being thereby vacated, ſo they may make unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able By-laws without the ſame danger of deſtroying the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The caſes are very many wherein By-laws have been judged unreaſonable; the truth of it is, there is a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in the perusing and making of thoſe By-laws; by ſome means or other there is ſomething diſcerned that ſtill proves an Exception to it, as we ſee in the Caſe of the Carmen and the Woodmongers; their By-law was made and re-made, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103424:19"/> again and again, before it would be made to hold Water in this Court. So in the Taylors of <hi>Ipſwich</hi>'s Caſe and <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi>'s Caſe, which was here lately. All theſe have béen adjudged void; but what then? In all theſe Caſes it was never ſaid, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your Corporation is deſtroyed, you have erred in making a By-law, and therefore you have loſt your being of a Corporation. Beſides, if there were but a colour for it, and it were any thing tollerable, ſurely that were enough to make us excuſable in ſuch a matter. If it has béen received as we agrée it has, the Officers are Treſpaſſers, every individual of them are ſuable, and any man may bring his Action againſt them. But they that come to the Market think not fit to complain; if they did not like the Market, they would not come at all; and if they did not like the Payment, they would not come neither; and there is no levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing unleſs they do come.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, I will admit the levying and the receiving, and yet I ſay this is no forfeiture; for here is a miſtake of Law, or a miſtake of Fact, by colour whereof Mony is received: This by no means will work a Forfeiture of a Corporation, for at that rate every Penalty that has béen levyed by a By-law will be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a levying of Mony without Law, and ſo forfeit the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has not béen done in other caſes of By-laws, and thoſe much worſe than this; becauſe moſt of thoſe By-laws were made for levying Mony upon Men for exerciſing a Trade; and 'tis much more to ſay that you ſhould levy ſuch Sums of Mony upon every ſtroke of honeſt induſtry, whereby a Man gets his Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, than that you ſhall pay ſo much for your accomodation in my ground for the better vending your Goods. This hath béen held good in ſome caſes, but in others it hath béen held naught; and this hath all béen received and levyed to the uſe of the City too, and ſo 'tis a levying of mony, whereby they have a great advantage; nay, 'tis worſe ſtill, becauſe it is impoſed by force, and recovered by force; but here 'tis a voluntary Penalty, no force, no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, only the being removed from their Standings, no other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, no Impriſonment, or the like; but if you do not like the conditions, you may be gone; I deſire you to walk out of this Market, if you don't like the price of the Proviſions; and to be gone from the Stall, if you don't like the price of the Standing. We were not bound to provide theſe Stalls for you, but having provided them, if you don't like them, you may leave them; but here is other caſes, the man is impriſoned, and ſued by Action for the Penalty; here at any time if you don't like your may be gone.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I am very confident that if this be ſo, that all monies levyed by a Corporation without Law are forfeitures; or where the Law is miſtaken, then I dare boldly affirm, that we never were a Corporation two months ſince <hi>London</hi> was <hi>London,</hi> but by vertue of ſome old ſléeping By-law or other that has béen ſet on foot, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103424:20"/> have béen levyed, which perhaps will not be in ſtrictneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed good: And if all theſe had béen Forfeitures, we had béen in a ſtrange condition, not one month or two ſhould paſs over us, but we had forfeited it; and never can there be perhaps a month to the end of the World, but we ſhould ſtill be forfeiting. And what is ſaid of us, may be ſaid of any other Corporation that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to make By-laws. And I am ſure in former times there were monies levyed with a witneſs, I mean not the late times of Rebellion only, but an hundred years ago, ſtrange exorbitances of that nature were committed by <hi>London</hi> and other Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; then they went by way of Information, but never was it thought that it could affect the being of a Corporation: If it ſhould do ſo, I do not know whither it will go at laſt. The greater or the leſſer Sum is not that that will difference the Law. Is it a Forfeiture to receive <hi>5000 l.?</hi> Why is it not a Forfeiture to receive <hi>500?</hi> Why not to receive <hi>5 s.?</hi> Why not to receive <hi>5 d.?</hi> No bounds can be ſet for that, if it be a tranſgreſſion of the Law; here is a Tort and a Wrong done by your By-law, that you have levyed <hi>5 d.</hi> and therefore all this great Inheritance of <hi>London,</hi> this that is the greateſt Inheritance of the Kingdom is forfeited for a Trifle, upon three half pence, or a Basket of Eggs.</p>
            <p>Nay my Lord, To go further I ſay, if this be a Forfeiture, I ſay 'tis only a Forfeiture of the Market; nay, not ſo much nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'tis only a Forfeiture of the Toll: my Lord, I cannot but once more mention that excellent Notion of my Lord <hi>Hobart,</hi> That the Power of making By-Laws is included in the Act of the Corporation; for as reaſon, ſays he, is given to a natural Body to govern it, ſo a Politick Body muſt have Laws, as its reaſon, to govern it. Now then the making of theſe Laws is but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that reaſon, declaring the mind of the Corporation, for the direction of the Officers of it what to do and what to take; and 'tis but like the mind of a man that directs his hand what to do. For this is not like the Duty of Stallage, that relates to the Publick, and relates alſo to ſomething that before they had no intereſt in, but only relates to the adminiſtration of a private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and directs the manner of that adminiſtration. They are Lords of the Market, and that is caſual to them, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them ſo to be. If any Corporation bid their Officers levy ſo much mony; ſuppoſe they bid them take more Toll than is due, or levy more mony for Rent than is due for the Land, why this might be looked upon as a great Breach of Truſt and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment: They ſhould have had but <hi>6 d.</hi> and they took <hi>7 d.</hi> and this done by Act of Common Council, which is their way of expreſſing their mind; yet ſurely it would be no Forfeiture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Land is their own, and the adminiſtration of it belongs to them only in point of intereſt and property. Suppoſe a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has a Market, and his Reaſon, which is his By-law, as my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, puts him upon taking of Toll, but he does
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103424:20"/> a little miſtake the Law or the Cuſtom, he bids his Servant take ſo much, which perhaps may be too much for Toll, does this deſtroy his capacity of Suing and being ſued? You may as well ſay ſuch a particular perſon ſhall not plead, or be impleaded, if he do ſo and ſo. Nay this, if he were a Denizen, does not forfeit his Denization, and yet a Denizen is as perfectly a creature of the Kings as a Corporation is. It is <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> it is the bounty and kindneſs of the King to one born out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, to give him the capacity of a Subject, to ſue and be ſued, and the like, which cannot be forfeited, even for breach of Conditions in the Letters Patents of Denization. For this is within <hi>Verſellin Mannings Caſe,</hi> if he does not obſerve the Laws of the Land; 'tis true, he muſt be puniſhed for it, but he ſhall not be undenizen'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> There is a Statute which I think is a moſt plain Declaration of the Law in this Caſe, and 'tis the Stat. of <hi>Weſt' 1. ca. 31.</hi> Some call it the <hi>30th,</hi> becauſe they differ in the numerating and heading of the Chapters. 'Tis the Statute concerning thoſe that take Outragious Tolls in Market-Towns. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſays, <hi>Le Roy prendra le Franchiſe del' March en ſa maine.</hi> The King ſhall ſeize the Franchiſe into his own Hands. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comment upon that Statute ſays, He ſhall ſeize the Franchiſe of the Fair or Market till it be redeemed by the owner, that's all. But this is intended ſays he, upon an Office to be found; for in Statutes, all incidents ſhall be ſupplyed by intendment.</p>
            <p>Now in the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> that was brought againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of <hi>Maidenhead</hi> in <hi>Palmer's Reports,</hi> there is this very caſe. That Corporation took an outragious Toll, too much Toll, or that that was not juſtifiable, for going over their Bridge. Yet it was ſo far from being imagined that this ſhould be a forfeiture, (and yet the Caſe is the ſame, let any man diſtinguiſh it that can) that it was a Queſtion whether the Market was forfeited or no, as you may ſee in that Book, <hi>fol. 82.</hi> And there 'tis ſaid by <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> and at laſt it was agreed by all the Court, that it ſhould be a forfeiture only of the Toll, and not of the Market. And I deſire that that Folio may be noted by your Lordſhip, and that you will pleaſe to look into what is ſaid in that Caſe, for 'tis debated before, and it ſeemed as if they would have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Market by it, but not the Corporation, and yet that was not forfeited neither. And to this I will apply that rule that <hi>Mr. Solicitor</hi> himſelf did mention, <hi>Puniatur in eo quo peccat.</hi> You have offended in the Toll, therefore you ſhall ſuffer in the Toll, not in the Market, to be ſure not in the Corporation. For if it were that it ſhould affect the Market, it would be becauſe it hath ſome relation to a Market, as a Toll hath; but how can this poſſibly affect or touch the Corporation? The Statute indéed goes thus far, and ſays, Whoſoever ſhall take Outragious Toll
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103424:21"/> ſhall forfeit the Market; but then ſhall we come and add, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall take outragious Toll, ſhall forfeit his capacity of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Market, or any thing elſe? Do they complain of us for taking the Legiſlative power upon us, and therefore we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our Corporation, when the Statute it ſelf has appointed the puniſhment, and ſays only, the Market ſhall be forfeited, and ſo make a new Law themſelves? Statutes are ſuppoſed to be penal enough of themſelves, and all penal Statutes are to be taken equitably as to the penalty, and not ſtretch'd beyond the Letter. And wherever a Statute inflicts a penalty, and ſays you ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ſo much, as my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, the Common Law ſhuts up the Negative, that you ſhall forfeit no more. How then is it poſſible we ſhould forfeit that, which if it were forfeitable at all, is not within the proviſion of this Law?</p>
            <p>'Tis true as Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> hath ſaid in the Book of Aſſizes that he cited in <hi>Vet. Nat. Brev' 161.</hi> It is ſaid you ſhall forfeit in the caſe of a miſ-uſer, (where the Liberties are not depending one upon another) only the Liberty that is abuſed, but how that can be applyed for him I underſtand not; for nothing can be more flat and plain againſt him: If ſo be we ſhould forfeit our Toll or our Market, be it ſo; nay, if we ſhould forfeit our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of having a Common Council; what then? how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring it up to a Forfeiture of the Corporation? You ſhall forfeit a Court of Pypowders, if you forfeit your Market, becauſe 'tis incident to it, and dependent upon it, and ſubject to what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Market it ſelf is ſubject to; but the being of a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing can tranſcend that. To be ſure what is incident to it, cannot tranſcend it; 'tis but a Subject to that which is is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</p>
            <p>For example ſake, my Lord, I will cite you a Caſe, which is the Caſe of the City of <hi>London</hi> too about the meaſurage of Coals. It is Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>1 Leon' 106.</hi> And I chooſe to cite that Book; for though it did not come out with your Lordſhips Authority, yet my late Lord Chancellor gave this juſt accompt of it, That it was one of the beſt of our later Reports. Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> libelled in the Admiralty againſt the Officer of the City for meaſuring Coals upon the Thames. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> came to the Bar, and prayed a Prohibition, and <hi>Edgerton</hi> the Solicitor on the other ſide complained, that the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> did take a Fine for this meaſurage, and made an Office of it; and this he conceived was Extortion (which is the thing complained of here in ſo many words) and being upon the Thames, ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the Admiralty. As to that the Iudges replyed, by no means, and <hi>Wrey &amp; Gawdey</hi> ſaid, if it be Extortion in the Mayor, there is no remedy for it in the Court of Admiralty, but in the Kings Courts, and it ſhall be redreſſed here in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> ſays <hi>Gawdy.</hi> 'Tis true, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> might well have been brought for redreſſing that Extortion, but it could not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103424:21"/> mean thereby that the Corporation ſhould be diſſolved: And that it was ſo underſtood is moſt plain, for accordingly a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> is brought. You have it in <hi>Cokes Entries fol. 535.</hi> and <hi>536. placit' 4.</hi> And the City of <hi>London</hi> appeared and pleaded, and preſcribed to it; and thereupon the Attorney General that then was, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, was ſatisfied, and confeſſed their Title, and Iudgment was given for them; and ſince it hath been held good, and they have enjoyed it in peace; and this I hope is a good Example for <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> to follow in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I come now to that part which I come leaſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to, I mean that of the Petition; and that which I have to ſay in it, is this my Lord. Firſt I ſay, That this Petition is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Pleading, and I hope it is very juſtifiable; if it were but excuſable, 'tis enough. That it is juſtifiable to Petition the King in our neceſſities and extremities is plain from what my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, <hi>fol. 220.</hi> He ſays it was reſolved by the Court in <hi>Renham</hi>'s Caſe, that it was lawful for any Subject to Petition to the King for a redreſs in an humble and modeſt manner: For as 'tis there ſaid, Acceſs to the Sovereign muſt not be ſhut up in caſe of the Subjects diſtreſſes. Now the Common Council are not leſs priviledged than any other ſure, but rather more in this kind of Addreſſing and Petitioning: I cannot tell what Crime to make of this, there is ſo much alledged againſt us.</p>
            <p>I did very well obſerve truly, and would always obſerve and remember in all ſuch Caſes, what my Lord-Kéeper here ſaid to your Lordſhip, That Council ſhould not ſo much ſpeak, as if they would abett the Guilt of their Clyent, rather than advocate for their innocency.</p>
            <p>My Lord, If the words themſelves that are alledged are not words that are unlawful to be delivered or ſpoken, then all this that they are dreſſed up with of the intention to cenſure the King, and to bring him into diſlike with his People, all that muſt go for nothing, and are not to weigh in the Caſe. Now the Words are theſe, That there was a Prorogation, and by means of this, there being depending ſo many Impeachments of Lords and others, and Bills in the Parliament in both Houſes, which could not be perfected any where but there; the proſecution of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Iuſtice, and the making Proviſions neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſty and his Proteſtant Subjects, received an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. Now, my Lord, I conceive theſe Words are not Words that in themſelves are unlawful: And for that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will be pleaſed to conſider our Plea; I néed not repeat it, you have it before you: If they are in ſenſe and ſubſtance the ſame Words that have béen ſpoken by the King, and the Lords and Commons in Parliament; he that will not be ſatisfied with that Authority, will not be ſatisfied with any. Then what do we ſay? We ſay that the proſecution of the publick Iuſtice received an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103424:22"/> does not the King ſay ſo, and more in his Spéech we have ſet forth, wherein he recommends it to both Houſes, that Iuſtice may be done? What is the meaning then but this, if the further proſecution of the Offenders goes not on, Iuſtice is not done? and ſo we ſpeak but the Kings Words. We ſay they are not tryed, or they were not tryed, they themſelves complain of it to this day; and therefore Iuſtice did receive an interruption. I am confident, without reflection, that Honourable Perſon my Lord <hi>Danby</hi> in this point hath ſaid Words much more liable to exception, though truly Words that I believe deſerve no rebuke. He has complained that Iuſtice was not done in his Caſe, becauſe he was not tryed, and that when he deſired to be tryed too, but his Liberty taken away, and he forfeited that which was dearer to him than Lands or Honours, his Health, whereby he endangered his Life, and loſt all the comforts of Life. If it were lawful for him to ſay, as certainly it was, That Iuſtice was not done in his Caſe, why might not the City ſay ſo? Either theſe Lords ought to be condemned, or they ought to be acquitted; 'tis hard to ſay Iuſtice is done, when they lie ſo long in Priſon, and are not either acquitted or condemned.</p>
            <p>Then we ſay this, That the making Proviſion for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Kings Perſon, and of his Proteſtant Subjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an interruption. To this part we give this Anſwer: We ſet forth, That there were Bills depending in the Parliament for this purpoſe, and that is agréed to us by the Demurrer; and that theſe Bills could not paſs into Laws, any more than the Lords could be tryed but in Parliament. Why then if ſo be it be ſo, that the matter cannot be done, nor proviſion made, but (as that Proclamation that iſſued for the Faſt ſaid, and as the Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of both Houſes for the Faſt do ſay) By the bleſſing of God upon the Counſels of King and Parliament; if theſe Counſels, or the King and his Parliament are interrupted, this is not done. To make ſuch an high Crime of this I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; I would not be thought to ſpeak any thing to juſtifie that which is really a Crime; but this is that I ſay, 'Tis not in Law unlawful for us to petition the King, or addreſs to him: But, my Lord, to take off the edge of this buſineſs, I ſhall beg leave to read to your Lordſhip a Spéech of the Kings, made the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following, and therein there are theſe Words, <hi>The further Proſecution of the Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, let any man read, and ſpell, and ſee how in ſubſtance the Words in our Petition differ from the Words of the King, making thoſe Laws neceſſary for the ſecurity of himſelf and the Kingdom, and this ſpoken the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> when this very Petition now complained of was preſented in <hi>January</hi> or <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> before, and there was no Parliament between. No man will ſay, that there were Laws ſufficient for the ſecurity of the King
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103424:22"/> and Kingdom, when the King himſelf ſpeaks of the neceſſity of making ſuch ones: So then, thoſe Laws that were preparing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an interruption. The Lords were not tryed, is not that an interruption of Iuſtice? ſince they could be tryed no where elſe, as muſt be granted; and the King recommends it to them as not done, but neceſſary to be done. So the King ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo 'tis implyed here. There is no ſuch thing ſaid in the Petition, <hi>That the King did interrupt Juſtice, and the proceedings of the Parliament;</hi> 'Tis an Inference and a Conſequence made by Wit and Art, not that the King did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt, or intend to interrupt Iuſtice; but it ſays, by <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Parliament, the publick Juſtice received an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Suppoſe at that time there had béen a Peſtilence here, and the King had been as much reſolved to meet his two Houſes as they him, but by reaſon of the Peſtilence he were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated and forced to make a Prorogation. Then there comes ſuch a Petition from the City and ſays, That by reaſon of this Prorogation, thoſe Bills that were depending did not paſs, and the publick Iuſtice received an Interruption: What is the Offence of this? 'Tis all true. If there be Bills depending, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments that can no other where be tryed, they do receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption by a Prorogation. Can any man ſay this is falſe? The charge in the Replication is, <hi>That we did falſly and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſay,</hi> what? that which is true, and that which the King had ſaid before, and that which the Lords and Commons ſaid after him, <hi>That till thoſe things were done they were not ſafe;</hi> and thoſe things as yet were not done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> There is this further in it, the Petition is ſet forth <hi>in haec verba,</hi> and therefore I may take any thing out of it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, and reſtore it to it ſelf; for this indeed is a very reſtrained conſtruction of the Petition.</p>
            <p>It ſays, when this interruption by the Prorogation was receiv'd, <hi>That the King for urgent cauſes, and very good reaſons, did Prorogue the Parliament.</hi> It is his Prerogative to do ſo, and God forbid but he ſhould have it. I think without doubt, we ſhould be more at a loſs for want of that Prerogative than we can by the uſe of it; 'tis mine, and I believe every good mans Opinion, that that Prerogative is very neceſſary and profitable for us all; but it is the conſequence of it that this interruption of Iuſtice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; nay, we are ſo far from ſaying that the King did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Iuſtice, or intending it, that we ſay, we do hope the Kings gracious intentions were only to make way for the better concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his Majeſty and his Parliament. The King does, <hi>for great cauſes,</hi> and beſt known to himſelf who has the Prerogative, <hi>Prorogue the Parliament;</hi> whereby as a meer conſequence, not as the Kings intention, <hi>the publick Juſtice is interrupted:</hi> Nay, this we affirm was with a good intention in the King, <hi>that he might
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103424:23"/> the better be inabled to concur with his Parliament,</hi> as is ſet forth in the Petition. Can there be any thing more properly ſaid? 'Tis the greateſt juſtification of the Prorogation that can be. The King has prorogued the Parliament: What to do? Why Iuſtice hath in view received an Interruption, but not in the intention of the King. We know what the meaning of it is, and ſo we ſet forth in our very Petition, <hi>it is to gain time, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concur with his Parliament.</hi> 'Tis a great commendation of the Kings purpoſe, inſtead of charging him with Injuſtice, that he did reſolve to concur with his Parliament for ſuch ends, and accordingly did Prorogue the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now the Attorney General hath put in that it was <hi>ea Intentione;</hi> there is the ſting of the buſineſs to put in thoſe words, to make that which we may lawfully ſpeak, of it ſelf to be an Offence; but truly that ſignifies juſt nothing: It can never hurt a thing that is true; it has great Authority in it if it be applyed to a thing that is unlawful; but if in ſubſtance it be true, and the thing it ſelf juſtifiable, thoſe Words make nothing in the Caſe; and I think I néed not argue that point, but refer my ſelf to the great Caſe that was in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and that is the Reverſal of the Iudgment given in this Court againſt my Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> which was a Reverſal in Parliament, and is Printed, and the laſt Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Coke</hi>'s Reports by order of Parliament, and there they explode all the notion of <hi>ea intentione,</hi> and this buſineſs. A man ſpeaks words that he might ſpeak in Parliament (though I know not whether he might or no) but the great thing is, If words that in themſelves are tollerable, to be ſpoken, be ſpoken, you ſhall not come and ſay they were ſpoken with an ill intention; though, as I ſhall ſhew by and by, this hath a kind of Fatality in it, and that is this, That it is done with an ill mind by a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that hath no mind at all.</p>
            <p>Mr. Attorney General. <hi>Juſt now you ſaid it had a mind, and Reaſon was its mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Recorder.</hi> I ſaid as my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, that a By-law to it is a mind, as reaſon is to a man, but it hath no moral mind. My Lord, then I ſay, the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were indéed at that time under great conſternation, by reaſon of the Conſpiracies that had béen diſcovered in Parliament, and in the Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and it had béen declared by the late Lord Chancellor at the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> which your Lordſhip may very well remember, <hi>That</hi> London <hi>was burnt by the Papiſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas no wonder that they were deſirous that themſelves and the Kingdom ſhould be put into great ſecurity againſt thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> This, my Lord, I confeſs is a tender point, and I would not ſpeak a word in't without a Law-book to back me. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, That Zeal and Indignation are fervent Paſſions. The City of <hi>London</hi> had great Indignation againſt the Papiſts for this Conſpiracy againſt the King and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103424:23"/> Kingdom, and the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law. There was no diſaffection in the City at this time when this Petition was made ſure, and I wonder that any man ſhould ſay, that knows <hi>London,</hi> and was acquainted with it then, and looks upon this Petition which paſſed <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> that they had ſuch an intention as is inſinuated; And pray let him read the Names of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Aldermen that then ſat upon the Bench, and the other Names of the Common Council-men then preſent, and then let him ſay, if, without Reflection, the King have more loyal Subjects in the City of <hi>London</hi> than theſe men were. And do you think if there had béen in it any Sedition, or any of thoſe ill qualities that make up the ill Adverbs which are joyned to it in the Replication, not one of all thoſe loyally-diſpos'd men would have ſpoken againſt it? But alas, all of it paſſed <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I ſay that if the matter of it be juſtifiable, as I think it is, then all theſe words will ſignifie nothing, if there were never ſo many more of them: And the preſenting and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it to the King, that is no Offence, that is not ſo much as pretended to be one. And, my Lord, I think it a very harſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the word into <hi>Latin,</hi> when the Petition ſays, That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Procéedings, or the publick Iuſtice received an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to put that word of <hi>Obſtructionem</hi> in; truly I think a better word might have béen found to expreſs the ſoft expreſſion in the Petition; and they néed not have put that hard violent word <hi>Obſtructionem,</hi> when to make Engliſh of it they tranſlated it <hi>Interruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my Lord, they do admit I ſay, That the making and preſenting of it to the King is not the Offence ſo much as the publiſhing of it, by which it is expoſed to many others beſides. Now to excuſe that, the Anſwer we give is this; and 'tis that which will carry a very reaſonable ground of Iuſtification in it. Certain Citizens that were private Men had petitioned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, and thereby they were importuned to make known the deſires of the City to the King, and it was reaſonable to make known to thoſe Citizens what the Common Council had done to prevent falſe Rumours, which we knew were rife enough in thoſe days; and to ſhew that there was nothing ill in it, we did Print it. And 'tis alſo all driving at the Common Intereſt, at the Kings Safety, the Preſervation of the Church and the Government eſtabliſhed: All this they did deſire might be known to theſe Citizens, and all others that enquired about it; and therefore they Printed it, to evidence that there was nothing of ill intended in it. And I do wonder I muſt confeſs, that this Objection of the publiſhing of this Petition ſhould be ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon; for they ſay, That the Mayor, Commonalty and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the City of <hi>London</hi> did it, and ſay not any thing of the Common Council that they did print it: Now they that did vote it, knew it without printing; and 'tis alledged in the Pleadings,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103424:24"/> and confeſſed by the Demurrer, That the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> that is, the Corporation, conſiſts of above <hi>50000</hi> Men, which cannot well be intended otherwiſe. Why then, here is a Petition that is agréed to be well enough lodged as to the Perſons that voted it, it being the liberty of the Subject to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; and if this had béen only preſented to the King, though it had béen by thoſe <hi>50000</hi> men, nay, if it had béen by <hi>10000</hi> men, who had béen the Corporation, It had béen well enough, ſo it had not béen printed, but only kept private to themſelves: Why then 'tis very ſtrange, that what is known to all <hi>London,</hi> ſo great a part of the Kingdom, ſhould be lawful, but it ſhould be heinouſly unlawful to ſend the news of it further. It went further than the City of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore 'tis ſuch an Offence as ſhall be a Forfeiture of the Corporation. My Lord, there is the Caſe of <hi>Lake</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> the Petition to the Parliament was ſcandalous in it ſelf, yet it ſtood protected, being preſented to the Parliament; and it was lawful to print it, provided it were delivered to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittée of Parliament, or only to thoſe that were Members; though 'tis ſaid there, that the printing of it is a great publiſhing, for the Compoſers, Correctors, and other Perſons that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Preſs read every Letter of it. But it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That Printing is but a more expeditious way of Writing; and if he had employed <hi>20</hi> Clerks, it had béen a greater publiſhing than thrée or four Printers. Poſſibly the Printers might not read it, or not be able to read it well, or not all of them read it at that time.</p>
            <p>Now here my Lord, Sure it was lawful to acquaint the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens what they had done, if you take it to be the Act of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, and the Common Council to be the Repreſentative of the City. It was always agreed by the Houſe of Commons, that any Member might ſend the Votes to thoſe that ſent them thither, and whom they repreſented; they have blamed indeed men for ſending the debates, but never for communicating the Votes: And what they may do by Writing, that they may do by Printing. Why then might not the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who by Cuſtom chooſe thoſe Common Council men, well deſire to know, and might well know what they had done; and then what they might do by Writing they might by Printing; for that is but another way, though a more ſuitable and compendious way of exhibiting any thing that you would have go to many. And if it be lawful to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to all the City, and all the City does know it, though it does go further 'tis no matter; for what is known to <hi>London,</hi> may very well be known to all the Nation beſides without Offence, if it did go further. Beſides, it ſhall never be intended it was publiſhed further, or that any others knew of it; for 'tis ſaid to be publiſhed in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Michael Baſſiſhaw,</hi> in the Ward of <hi>Baſſiſhaw,</hi> and that is in <hi>London,</hi> to the Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> and ſo they only talked of it amongſt themſelves. Beſides, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103424:24"/> main thing I go upon, which is, if there be no ill in the thing it ſelf, the <hi>ea intentione</hi> can make no crime by a bare affirmation, which we deny; and if it might be well ſaid or done, it is lawful to Print it, and the Publication is no Offence neither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> The next point I come to is this, <hi>That a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot poſſibly commit a Capital Crime, or any other Crime againſt the Peace:</hi> And I ſhall offer this Dilemma, Either it was done ſeditiouſly or not; if not, then there is no ſufficient Aſſignment of a cauſe of forfeiture; if it were, then 'tis a crime, for which the Offender is indictable; and that I ſay is abſolutely impoſſible for a Corporation to be guilty of. And here I will throw in alſo that buſineſs of the Toll, and I will for argument ſake, admit the taking of a wrongful Toll to be Robbery, and then let the argument go on. I have heard it ſaid within the Bar occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, that a Corporation is intruſted with the Government, and that they may commit Treaſon, and raiſe Sedition, as Mr. <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor</hi> hath ſaid; I ſuppoſe it muſt be under their Great Seal: But I confeſs, I believe it is rather ſpoken to amuſe than to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie; but I really think it is no ill, nor unjuſtifiable thing for me to ſay, nor againſt the Government to affirm, That 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a Corporation can commit Treaſon, or that it is intruſted with the Government in any ſuch kind.</p>
            <p>But firſt my Lord, I ſhall ſhew you what Opinion former times had, and that becauſe ſuch an Opinion as this hath been broached of late days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice. <hi>Mr Recorder, Will you be much longer? Becauſe I muſt ſit here at</hi> Niſi prius <hi>this Afternoon, and yet I would feign hear the Argument, if it would not be too long.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi> No my Lord, I have almoſt done, and will cut ſhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>21 E. 4. fol. 13. b.</hi> 'tis ſaid by <hi>Pigott,</hi> That a Mayor has two abilities, the one to his own uſe, to take and to grant, and to do as another natural perſon does; and then the Mayor as Mayor and Commonalty, hath another Capacity to their common uſe and profit; and that is but a name, an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> a thing that cannot be ſeen, and is no ſubſtance; and for this name or Corporation 'tis impoſſible they can do or ſuffer any wrong, as to beat or be beaten, as ſuch a Body; but the wrong is made to every member of the Body, as to his own proper perſon, and not as to the name of Corporation; nor can the Corporation do a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wrong to another; nor can they commit Treaſon nor Felony as to the Corporation, nor againſt any other perſon. And if a Writ of Debt be brought againſt the Mayor and Commonalty, or other ſuch Body, upon an Obligation, and they plead it is not their Deed, and it is found their Deed, they ſhall not be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned as another ſingle perſon ſhall. The ſame Law is if they are found Diſſeſſors with force, they ſhall not be impriſoned; nor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103424:25"/> in a Writ of Raviſhment of Ward they ſhall neither be impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor abjure the Realm; for ſuch a Body is hut a name, to which ſuch an act cannot be done. So ſays <hi>Catesby</hi> in the ſame Book. In a Writ brought againſt them no <hi>Capias</hi> ſhall iſſue, becauſe they are but as a dead perſon in Law, and the Appearance upon a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> cannot be otherwiſe than perſonal. And ſo to this purpoſe ſays the Chief Iuſtice there, If this Body will do any thing, it muſt be done by Writing. And all along it is the Tenor of the whole Caſe, that a Corporation cannot commit Treaſon, or any other Crime. But the reaſon of the thing is above any Authority. Suppoſe that they under their Common Seal ſhould commit Treaſon, and you bring an Indictment of Treaſon againſt the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of the City of <hi>London,</hi> what Iudgment ſhall be given againſt them in their corporate capacity? What? it ſhall be that <hi>Suſpendatur per collum Corpus politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi> And then, what execution ſhall be done upon that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? What muſt they hang up the Common Seal? Nothing elſe you can do can affect them; but in their private capacity, there they may be puniſhed as ſingle perſons.</p>
            <p>A Penal Statute ſays, That he or ſhe that offends againſt the Law ſhall forfeit ſo much, or incur ſuch a Penalty: Is a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Male or Female? that it ſhould come under ſuch a proviſion; but the real reaſon of the Law is this, it is a civil Being, it is <hi>Ens civile,</hi> it is <hi>Corpus politicum,</hi> it hath civil qualities, but it hath no moral qualities, and all Offences conſiſt in the immorality of them, and there muſt be malice to make that immorality. No words or Acts are Treaſon or Felony, unleſs there be a traiterous mind or a felonious mind, and therefore a mad-man cannot be guilty of Treaſon or Felony. Serjeant <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> brought an Action for theſe words, That he had ſpoken Treaſon; it was moved in Arreſt of Iudgment, that this cannot be Actionable; for he might ſpeak Treaſon in putting a Caſe; ay, that were well, ſaid they, if it could be underſtood ſo; but we muſt intend it that he ſpoke Treaſon, as his own words <hi>ex corde ſuo,</hi> which makes it Treaſon; for Treaſon conſiſts in the immorality of the mind.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is what <hi>Pigot</hi> ſaid, as I ſaid before, That a Corporation is but a Name, an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> a thing that cannot ſée or be ſéen, and indéed is no ſubſtance, nor can do or ſuffer wrong, nor any thing where a corporal appearance is requiſite. What my Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> ſays in <hi>Moor 68.</hi> that he never ſaw, is, I believe, true in general, that no Man ever did ſée, that a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration could be bound in a Recognizance or Statute Merchant; and why? becauſe it muſt be acknowledged in perſon: And ſo in this caſe, The Guilt follows the Perſon, but cannot a méer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. In all Crimes the Offender muſt appear in perſon, and plead in perſon, and ſuffer in perſon; but you can never bring the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens into Goal, to appear and plead
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103424:25"/> to an Indictment to receive a Iudgment, or ſuffer Execution. Can a Body Politique that is inviſible appear in perſon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But then there is this great Objection, <hi>By this means,</hi> they ſay, <hi>if there be no puniſhing of them, there is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they may commit Treaſon under the great Seal, they may raiſe Armies, and inſtigate a Rebellion, and all with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> My Lord I ſay no, and I give two Anſwers to it that are not to be replyed to; and the firſt is this:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> All theſe Perſons that are met together, though they are met <hi>corporaliter,</hi> in their corporate capacity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r the Acts of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at that time; yet when they go out of their corporate buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and commit Treaſon or Felony, the Crime does not <hi>egredi perſonas,</hi> every one of them is a Traitor or a Felon; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they appeared there under the pretence of a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they are all liable in their private ſeveral Capacities, every one of them muſt be indicted perſonally, and ſuffer perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: For when they go about to do ſuch a thing, 'tis out of the buſineſs of the Corporation, and they muſt anſwer for their own particular Offences. But,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I have another Anſwer to give to it. This Objection is to be retorted on the other ſide, That if a Corporation authorize the levying of War under their Common Seal, ſhall be affected by it in their politick Capacity, they are lyable to the Law in that Capacity only, and muſt ſuffer in that Capacity only: And the conſequence of that is, they are diſcharged in their private Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and this is a Law of Indempnity and Protection for all Crimes, for a man cannot be lyable two ways for Treaſon or Felony, or any other Crimes; if he be not lyable in his private, he is in his publick Capacity; if not in his publick, he is in his private. And what is the conſequence of that? This is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for a Corporation met together in a Body, to do any illegal thing, or to commit any enormous Crime; for the Kings Counſel ſays this, We are <hi>reſponſible for it in our politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;</hi> and what Execution can then be done to puniſh that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration with ſuch a puniſhment as the Law inflicts, that is, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment or death, any more than upon an Action of Debt brought againſt them upon a Bond, and <hi>Non eſt factum</hi> pleaded, and found for the Plaintiff, they can be impriſoned, and the like. So that this ſhall protect and ſhelter them in the commiſſion of any Capital Offence; for if they are to ſuffer for it as a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you muſt take Iudgment againſt them as the Law gives it; and how will that be done againſt an inviſible Body? What will be the Execution againſt the <hi>Corpus Politicum,</hi> that can neither ſee nor be ſeen?</p>
            <p>I think this mighty plain; and I muſt confeſs, I wonder how it could ever enter into the mind of any man, that a Corporation could commit a Corporate Crime. I have as it became me, in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103424:26"/> regard of the duty of my place, and before that, for my own Learning, read <hi>Stamford's Pleas of the Crown,</hi> my Lord <hi>Cokes 4th Inſtitutes, Poulton de Pace Regni,</hi> my Lord <hi>Hales's Pleas of the Crown, Dalton's Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> and other Books of that Subject, but I defie any man to ſhew me in any of thoſe Treatiſes concerning Criminal Matters, any reſolution, that ever a Corporation that could be concerned, that they ſhould be brought before a Iuſtice of Peace, or proceeded againſt upon any Law for Treaſon or Felony, or be hanged in their politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſhall conclude all my diſcourſe of this kind, (and I have almoſt done, becauſe I perceive I encroach upon your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, with an obſervation I have made upon the <hi>19 H. 7. c.</hi> And and 'tis the Statute that makes proviſion againſt Corporations, that made By-laws againſt the Prerogative. That Statute ſays, that ſome Corporations did ſo; now an higher Offence than that, ſure cannot well be deſcribed; and there that Law ſays, that thoſe that do ſo, that make ſuch By-laws againſt the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, ſhall forfeit for ſo doing for every Offence Forty pound, unleſs they are confirmed by the Chancellor and Treaſurer, and Chief Iuſtices, or any thrée of them. Now to what purpoſe was this Statute made; if the making of an ill By-law (and worſe cannot be than a By-law againſt the Kings Prerogative) ſhould be a forfeiture of the being of a Corporation? How vainly did the King and Parliament employ themſelves to make a Statute that a Corporation ſhould forfeit <hi>40 l.</hi> for ſuch an Offence? No Man will ſay they had rather take that Penalty than another, when they might have a greater, if a greater could be had by Law. If they might have had a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> and thereby deſtroyed the Corporation, ſurely they would not have ſtood for the Penalty of <hi>40 l.</hi> for they might eaſily have got more mony: No, they might have ſaid, We will never paſs it by, unleſs you will give us <hi>4000 l.</hi> or a far greater Sum; nor ſhall you have your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration again, without you give us a conſiderable recompenſe for it: And when the proceſs and the procéedings were ſo expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eaſie to come at it in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> as it was eaſie in thoſe days, why ſhould they put the King to the delays in an Action of Debt for ſo ſmall a Penalty as <hi>40 l.?</hi> So that I take it to be a direct Iudgment of the Parliament in that Caſe, that no Corporation ſhould or could be forfeited for the making of any By-Law that was irregular, though it were even againſt the Kings Prerogative.</p>
            <p>But to haſten to a concluſion, I have all this while, my Lord, ſuppoſed, that the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of <hi>London</hi> have done this, but it is not ſo; this is not the Act of the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens, 'tis not the two hundreth part of the Corporation, 'tis but the Act of the Common Council; and we have diſtinguiſhed our ſelves by pleading, that it does not conſiſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103424:26"/> of above <hi>250,</hi> when the City contains above <hi>50000.</hi> I muſt confeſs the Council is not taken notice of much in Law; as is ſéen in <hi>Warren</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>2 Crook 540. &amp; 2 Rolls 112. Warren</hi> being one of the Common Council of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and diſplaced, ſued out a Writ of Reſtitution, and upon that Writ it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, that by cuſtom the City might place and diſplace <hi>ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum;</hi> they there held that the cuſtom was good: But it is not ſo of a Fréeman or Alderman, becauſe he hath a Fréehold; but a Common Council is a thing collateral to a Corporation, and the Office of a Common Council is nothing but only to give aſſiſtance and advice, which they may refuſe at their pleaſure. In <hi>Eſtwick</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Style 32. &amp; 2 Rolls 456.</hi> it is ſaid, That 'tis a place méer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by cuſtom, and that the Common Council is properly but only a Court of Advice; and, my Lord, you ſhall never intend more than that they were a Court of advice: All the riſe of their Power is but by cuſtom, and that cuſtom is pleaded to give advice for the benefit of the City, and make By-laws for the good of the Corporation, and that is confeſſed by the Demurrer, and you ſhall intend no more than what is opened in the pleading.</p>
            <p>And then 'tis evident this was done by a very ſmall part of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and that does no way affect the whole Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure. In <hi>James Baggs</hi> Caſe, <hi>1 Rolls, fol 226.</hi> it is ſaid, That if a Patent be procured by ſome perſons of a Corporation, and the greater part do not aſſent to it, that ſhall not bind a Corporation. And if ſo be a Charter ſealed, and ſent by the King, becauſe not accepted <hi>in pais,</hi> by the greater party, bind not, Shall an Act done by a few, and an Act done that tends to a Forfeiture, bind the whole in point of their being? There is no ground to ſay, that the Common Council repreſents the City, no more than a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil does his Client, or an Attorney his Maſter; only as far as is for the benefit of the City, they are choſen and entruſted to make By-laws; if they offend, they are but Miniſters and Officers, and ſo they are within the Statute of <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> which I mention, though I think we have no néed of that in the caſe to help us; if they make a unreaſonable By-law, 'tis void, and every man that is aggrieved by it may have his Remedy, may bring his Action. Shall you ſupply this by an intendment, that they have ſuch a relation? That they are the Repreſentatives of the City of <hi>London?</hi> That they have a power to forfeit the Corporation? No, my Lord, by Law they are part of the Corporation, but they have no ſuch power to forfeit the Corporation. A cuſtom ſhall never be conſtrued to enable a man to do a wrong; and a great wrong it is, that they that are truſted, and truſted but for a year, and truſted but for the good of the Corporation, of which they are part, ſhould give up the being, or what is worſe, forfeit the being of that Corporation. The cuſtom of <hi>Kent</hi> that makes an Infant capable of making a Feoffment, ſhall never inable an Infant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Tayl, to make a Feoffment, ſo as to work a diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103424:27"/> of the Eſtate Tayl, and put the Heir to his <hi>Formedon.</hi> Every illegal Act of theirs is beyond their Commiſſion, and a nullity of that is all in reſpect of themſelves; and 'tis as if they the had never done it as to the Corporation, for they are by no means the Corporation; for tho they uſe the Comm Seal in ſome caſes at ſome times; ſo do the Court of Aldermen in other caſes; but it is only in other caſes wherein they are particularly intruſted. If an Act of Common Council ſay, that I ſhall have ſuch and ſuch Lands of the Cities, that Act fignifies nothing but as a direction and adviſe; when 'tis under the Common Seal, 'tis an Act of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and procéeding by advice of Common Council, it binds.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, this is the more unreaſonable, becauſe we know that the practice of the Common Council in <hi>London,</hi> being to adviſe for all the Inhabitants, they are choſen by the unfrée-men as well as others; and 'tis a ſtrange thing that they ſhould have a capacity to give away the liberty of the Citizens, when they are choſen by others as well as them; they had no ſuch truſt for them; nay, all truſt they had was to kéep their Liberties, and not to deſtroy them. Has any Man a truſt to deſtroy himſelf? ſure no Man is truſted by God himſelf to be <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then you can never underſtand it to be in the nature of a Truſt to deſtroy another; and the leaſt Citizen, my Lord, has as much and as true an intereſt in the Corporation of the City of <hi>London,</hi> as the greateſt: And therefore <hi>250,</hi> if they had béen much the greater number of the Citizens, would ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the reſt of the Body.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I ſhall only ſay this little more, here is no crime charged relating to them as a Corporation: Here is indéed a fine word uſed, that we did this <hi>contra fiduciam in corpore politico repoſitam,</hi> but all this is but an imaginary Truſt, the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave them a power or authority, or entruſted them to make By-laws that were unreaſonable; he gave them a power to make reaſonable By-laws, and ſo he does every Corporation. And the ſame Law that gave them the power, limits that power, and ſays, if they go beyond that power, 'tis a nullity. And theſe Acts relate not to them as a Corporation; the Petition is not ſo much as ſaid to be againſt any truſt repoſed in the Corporation, certainly there never was any ſuch Truſt. Did ever the King entruſt them to adviſe him about the matters contained in the Petition? and if not, then 'tis not <hi>contra fiduciam;</hi> therefore it relates to particular perſons: If it be an Offence, I hope 'tis none of the Corporations.</p>
            <p>But then the levying of Mony, that is <hi>contra fiduciam;</hi> they took upon them an illegal and unjuſt power in the Common
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103424:27"/> Council. Suppoſe it ſo, how does this belong to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? 'tis an encroachment upon property, 'tis the moſt arbitrary thing in the world. Whether they have the Market, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of it or not, is matter of Fact, and being pleaded, is confeſſed by the Demurrer: And then for the power of making By-laws, that is a thing that cannot poſſibly be taken from them while they are a Corporation; 'tis that which muſt be in them as a Corporation, like the faculty of Reaſon in a Man to expreſs his Reſolutions by. And 'tis no more, than if a man that has a Market, bid his Servant go and remove ſuch as have Stalls there, unleſs they will pay ſo much. That direction is as good a Law as this, and as bad a Law as this, and no more. There is nothing elſe in it but the direction of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, what they ſhall do in the ordering of the Markets, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Cities Property.</p>
            <p>Then as to the former method of expreſſing themſelves, whether it be by Act of Common Council, or under the Common Seal, or by their natural Voice, 'tis all one, 'tis not a thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them as a Body Politique: But if it were illegal and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, I ſay, the Penalty is only, that it ſhall be void. What the Common Council, nay what the Corporation does within the limits of its Authority is good, what beyond that it does, is void. If I command my Servant to diſtrain for Rent, and he kills a Man in the doing of it, this, as to me, is void; but as to himſelf, that is chargeable upon him. And what I ſay of the Common Council, I ſay of the Corporation it ſelf, That it is a Capacity, and a limited Capacity; 'tis the act of the Members, not of the Corporation, if they do wrong. The Common Council can act for the good of the City, and the City can do no more, if they themſelves ſhould méet, <hi>Crooke, Eliz. fol. 85.</hi> The Quéen makes a Leaſe for years of Lands to the men of <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> by the name of Aldermen, and they by that name grant all their Intereſt to <hi>Clerk;</hi> ſays that Book, this is void; for the Quéen granting them a Leaſe as to the Aldermen of <hi>Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> this makes them a Corporation, and gives them a capacity to take, but not to grant. And ſo <hi>Rolls Abr. 1 p. 513.</hi> And therefore no Corporation is to be conſidered as a Corporation, but only when it acts according to the capacity allowed to it; and as to the reſt, it all turns into their private capacity, but it affects not the Body, nor hath any ſuch relation as to bind it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, All the Queſtion here is, Whether there ſhall be ſuch a Perſon <hi>in Eſſe</hi> as this Corporation? Whether the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall ſubſiſt as ſuch a Perſon, to ſue and be ſued, to plead and be empleaded? There is nothing of Government or Miſgovernment in the caſe, but 'tis all about our Capacity,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103424:28"/> and nothing elſe, whether we ſhall be Defendant or Plantiff in any Court.</p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and all the other Acts that have gone in confirmation of it, ſhew the great care of the Government in all Ages to preſerve the City of <hi>London,</hi> and I look upon them as ſo many Declarations of the immortality of it, and all other Corporations. I ſhall uſe a ſtrange Argument perhaps at firſt hearing, but 'tis to me a great Evidence for us, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> does not confirm our being, but our Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; it ſays, That the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall have all its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, it confirms its Léets, its Markets, and all thoſe things, that is, it confirms all that it has; it has not ſaved indéed, if a Corporation indéed be built upon a Corporation; but that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Liberty may be deſtroyed, as that of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and the like, but it does more than confirm its being, for it does impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly declare, That that was impoſſible to be forfeited: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what néeded confirmation; but for their being there was no néed of that, it only confirmed the ſupervenient Liberties, with out which it might be a Corporation; but as to its being, it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not with that: And if it were not ſo, it were an unreaſonable thing that we ſhould have ſo many Acts of Parliament that give ſuch particular Powers to the Mayor and Commonalty of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and ſcarce any Act of Parliament that relates to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but <hi>London</hi> is mentioned, and taken care of in it. Are not all theſe Declarations that <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſtand for ever? Would not any one have ſaid elſe, Pray what do you put ſuch confidence in <hi>London</hi> for? There is not ſuch a fickle thing upon the Earth as the being of the Corporation of <hi>London.</hi> If they lay but <hi>6 d.</hi> upon a Ioynt of Meat they are gone, and there is not a month in the year but they forfeit their being.</p>
            <p>The Act for Adminiſtration hath a Proviſo, that ſays it ſhall not extend to <hi>London:</hi> Why does any Man think that this Law was not intended to be as perpetual for <hi>London,</hi> as for other parts of the Kingdom? They did not queſtion but <hi>London</hi> would be a Corporation as long as <hi>England</hi> was <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be a ſtrange thing in the Example of it, that the World ſhould be taught by one inſtance, that a Corporation can be ruined, when ſo many People put their Truſts in thoſe Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſo many vaſt Inheritances depend upon them. And I think the King and the Government, or thoſe you call ſo, are more concerned to preſerve <hi>London,</hi> than all the Perſons that are in it. I would not ſpeak it in this place by way of Argument for my Client, but I think I could maintain it in all places; only I hope and believe I ſhall have no néed for it.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:103424:28"/>
            <p>My Lord, All Innovations, as this muſt certainly be a very great one, are dangerous: This Frame of Government hath laſted and béen preſerved for many hundreds of years, and I hope will do ſo as long as the World laſts. My Lord, I néed your Patience, but I have juſt done. Here is a Charge that is very little indéed, there is nothing in the matter of it, but the great conſequences are fitter to be meditated on than ſpoken of. And therefore for theſe Reaſons I do pray, That theſe Liberties may be adjudged to us, and we may be diſmiſſed out of this Court.</p>

               <head>Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> Attorney General, for the KING.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THIS Information is not brought for the taking away or deſtroying the Corporation; for tho it be true that there be in it the words, <hi>Et penitus excludatur,</hi> yet that is but form; the intention is only to prune and take away the Exceſſes and Abuſes, and therefore no danger of falling into ſuch inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as ſuggeſted on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rolls Abr. Tit. Prerog.</hi> 204. It appears by Petitions in Parliament, that <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> and other Cities, have had their Liberties ſeized into the Kings hands for ſome abuſes and miſcarriages in the Cities, and ſometimes reſtitution grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, other times refuſed, and anſwered, that they were in good condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe Petitions were 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Liberties of the City are not intended to be deſtroyed, but preſerved and maintained, and this Suit deſigned to that end.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That this Information brought againſt the Corporation by the name of Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens, is good and well brought.</p>
               <p>What is alledged againſt it out of my Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Hales</hi> his Book, is not any opinion, but a <hi>Nota</hi> upon the Caſe of <hi>Cuſack.</hi>

               <p>It is not neceſſarily intended, that though they are ſued by the name of Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens, that they are ſued as a Corporation or Body Politique. For by thoſe words, <hi>[the Citizens and Inhabitants]</hi> are comprehended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and an Information lies well againſt Inhabitants or Citizens, without naming any perſons by particular name; and there are divers Preſidents of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s ſo brought.</p>

Next that the Replication alledging Forfeiture is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Information; for though the Forfeiture ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Franchiſe, yet it remains not veſted in the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Forfeiture appears upon Record by Office or Inquiſition finding it, or by Iudgment upon Information; and therefore this Information well brought againſt the Corporation.</p>

               <head>Mr. <hi>Pollexfen,</hi> upon another day for the City, his Argument.</head>
               <p>IN this Caſe, when I conſider the greatneſs and conſequence of it, That it affects the King, the Parliament, the Laws, the very Government under which we have lived, this great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> and all other Corporations and People of <hi>England,</hi> and their Poſterities, for ever. I cannot but be troubled that I ſhould be the Man to whoſe Lot it ſhould fall to argue it; but that which comforts me is, that your Lordſhip and the Court, upon whom the Iudgment of this great Caſe depends, will help out my Defects, and according to what is required in the great Places you bear, take care and provide, that by your Iudgment the ancient Government and Laws of this Kingdom receive no Damage or Alteration.</p>
               <p>The King's Counſel have on their ſide only ſome general words out of old Records of Forfeitures and Seiſures of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are of uncertain and doubtfull ſenſe; but there is not on their ſide produced any one Precedent, Iudgment, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to maintain the point in queſtion, <hi>viz. That a Corporation, or Body Politick, ever was determined, or diſſolved, or taken away for a Forfeiture.</hi> No, not in the maddeſt of Times, in the Times of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> when the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Diſorders were ſo great, that they not only ſeized and took away Liberties and Franchiſes, but the Lives of Princes, Nobles, Iudges, Lawyers, and all that ſtood in their way: In thoſe times, though they have hunted and ſearched with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, not one inſtance of a Corporation taken away, or diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a Forfeiture is cited. So that from hence I hope I may ſafely conclude, that I argue in this caſe for the old and known Laws, as they have been ever practiſed through all Ages, and againſt that which never hath been practized or known, which is a great Encouragement to me.</p>
               <p>The Pleadings being very long, I ſhall only repeat ſo much of them as I uſe, when I come in order to ſpeak of them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The firſt thing proper to be ſpoken to is the Information it ſelf, and therein I make this Queſtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether as to that part thereof that chargeth the Corporation with uſurping upon themſelves the being of a Corporation, whether that be properly brought againſt the Body Politick, as this is, or ought to have been brought againſt the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons?</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103424:32"/>
               <p>I do agree, that as to the other things mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the having Sheriffs, Iuſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Information is properly brought againſt the Corporation: And I do alſo agree, that it may be good as to thoſe things, though bad and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as to the charging the Corporation with Vſurpation of their Being, without lawfull Warrant or Authority. And that I may come ſingly to this Queſtion, I do put out all the other Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes in the Information, and take only what concerns this point, and then the Information, as to this point, chargeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> by the ſpace of a Month laſt paſt before the Information, did uſe, and claim to have and uſe, without any Warrant or Regal Conceſſion within the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Liberty and Franchiſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a Body Politick <hi>Re, Facto, &amp; Nomine,</hi> by name of Mayor, and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Citizens, and by that Name to plead and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded; which Liberty, Privilege, and Franchiſe, the ſame Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens, upon the King by the time aforeſaid have and yet do uſurp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Subſtance of the Information as to this point; and,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether this Information thus brought, as to this matter, be ſufficient in the Law, upon which a Judgment can be given, or ought to have been brought againſt particular Perſons,</hi> is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I conceive it ought to have been brought againſt particular Perſons, and is inſufficient as it is, and that no Iudgment can be given upon it, ſuppoſing the Defendants had demurred, or pleaded nothing to it.</p>
               <p>To make out the Inſufficiencies, I deſire to conſider what it imports:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The very bringing the Writ, and exhibiting the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Corporation, imports and admits the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens, to be a Body Politick, capable to be ſued and impleaded, <hi>reſpondere, &amp; reſponderi,</hi> otherwiſe there is no Defendant, no Perſon in Court, againſt whom the Suit is brought. It is not enough that the Perſon ſued be a Perſon by ſuppoſition, or a pretended Perſon, but none in reality. If a Writ or Information be brought againſt a Baron and Feme, this muſt admit that they are Baron and Feme really and truly; and if there be any thing after in the Writ or Information, that ſhews that they are not truly and really Baron and Feme, but that they do wrongfully and unduly take upon them to be Baron and Feme, when in truth they are not, this would be contrariant and repugnant, and abate the Writ or Information. The like is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the bringing the Writ or Information againſt the Body Politick; it ſuppoſeth and affirmeth them really and truly to be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103424:32"/> ſuch, and the ſubſequent Affirmation that they uſurped, ſo to be, and are not ſo really, is contrariant and repugnant.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> When in the Information it is alleadged, that the ayor, Commonalty, and Citizens, the Liberty, Privilege, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe of being a Body Politick <hi>Re, Facto, &amp; Nomine,</hi> and to be ſued and impleaded, upon the King have and yet do uſurp.</p>
               <p>To uſurp or doe any Act of Neceſſity, imports and admits a precedent exiſtence of the Perſons that doth uſurp, or do the Act, to the Act done. Particular Perſons may uſurp, and take upon themſelves that which they have no right unto: The Perſons that doe the Act did before exiſt, and had a Being. And when a Corporation is ſaid to uſurp, it of neceſſity muſt be ſuppoſed to have a precedent Being. The ſenſe of Vſurpation in a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto,</hi> is the Subject's taking upon him Franchiſes without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Inſt. 1.277. b.</note> 
                  <hi>That Uſurpation in the Common Law hath two ſignifications:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. The one when a Stranger preſents to a Benefice, and his Clerk inſtituted and inducted, he gains the Advowſon by Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. The other when any Subject without lawfull Warrant doth uſe any Royal Franchiſes, he is ſaid then to uſurp upon the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that an Vſurpation ſuppoſeth of neceſſity a Subject or a Perſon precedently <hi>in eſſo,</hi> that uſeth the Franchiſe, or that doth uſurp. That which is not <hi>in eſſe,</hi> that hath no exiſtence, cannot uſe any Franchiſe, cannot uſurp. The very alleadging that they uſurp, doth admit of neceſſity an Exiſtence precedent in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, ſuch as can uſurp, or Act, and therefore this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is inconſiſtent with it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> But another reaſon to prove that it ought to be againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and cannot be againſt the Body Politick, is drawn from the Iudgment that muſt be given upon this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Iudgment for the King. The Iudgment muſt have two things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> To damn the Corporation, <hi>Quod penitus extinguatur &amp; excludatur</hi> from being a Corporation for the future; for being wrongfully uſurped, it cannot be continued: A Iudgment to continue Wrong and Vſurpation can never be a right Iudgment.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> A Fine to the King for the uſurping it for the time paſt.</p>
               <p>This Iudgment may and ought to be given, where the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is againſt particular Perſons, for uſurping upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be a Corporation, and they ſhall be fined and impriſoned; but this cannot be where the Information is againſt the Body Politick; for by the Iudgment the Body Politick is extinguiſhed and diſſolved, and no Fine can be impoſed upon that which is not: So that hereby the King muſt loſe his Fine, which the particular Perſons uſurping ought to pay, and the Law is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able always to it ſelf, and the means anſwerable to the end. I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103424:33"/> ſuppoſe no man will affirm, that where a Suit or Iudgment is againſt a Corporation, that the Fine or Execution ſhall be againſt all, or any particular Member.</p>
               <p>For the Precedents and Authorities in this point,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> I do agree, that there be Precedents in the Crown Office of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s brought againſt Corporations in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this is brought, for uſurping to be a Corporation, and to claim divers other Liberties.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> For that they all being for claiming other Liberties, as well as to be a Corporation, and being good and ſufficient as to the other Liberties and Privileges that the Corporation claims; though inſufficient for this of claiming to be a Corporation, they muſt be proceeded upon, if the Attorney pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>But is any to be found where only the claiming to be a Body Politick, and nothing elſe; or if other things queſtioned, yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded in as to this particular of claiming to be a Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, as in this Caſe?

               <p>There is no mention of this Caſe in any Book or Report as far as I can learn; ſo that this paſſed <hi>ſub ſilentio.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I have made enquiry after this Borough of <hi>New Malton;</hi> it is a ſmall Borough, within the Manour of the Anceſtours of my Lord <hi>Eure;</hi> it did anciently ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, but from the time of King <hi>Ed. 1.</hi> to the beginning of the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>1640.</hi> it ſent none then; upon Petition a Writ orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they then and ever ſince have choſen Burgeſſes; my Lord <hi>Eure</hi> being Lord of the Manour, and offended with them, did proſecute this <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> and they having neither Lands, Revenues, or Eſtates to defend themſelves, he eaſily prevailed, they never in truth being incorporate, nor having any Charter.

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:103424:34"/>
               <p>This is poſitive.</p>
               <p>This, if it were only my Lord <hi>Hales</hi>'s Iudgment, were of no little Authority, but I think it is a Report taken upon the Caſe of the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt <hi>Cuſack,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Attorney finding, as I believe, that all the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to be againſt him. For in them all there are either <hi>non Proſſ.</hi> or no Procéedings to Iudgment, the Cauſes whereof, or at leaſt ſome of them, probably might be the Inſufficiencies of theſe Informations.</p>
               <p>And finding alſo the Authorities in Print which have been cited to be all againſt him, and none for him, endeavoured to maintain the Information as brought not againſt the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but againſt the Citizens or Inhabitants of the City in their Natural Capacities, and to that purpoſe cited the Caſe, <hi>C. En. 537.</hi> of a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the Inhabitants of a Village, <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> they claimed to be a Body Politick.</p>
               <p>And argued, That a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> lyes againſt the <hi>Cives</hi> of ſuch a City, or <hi>Burgenſes</hi> or Tenants.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be rather a ſudden conceit, and altogether undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and not well conſidered.</p>
               <p>But in anſwer thereunto, and to prove that this Writ is brought againſt the Defendants as a Corporation, and cannot legally be taken in any other Caſe.</p>
               <p>If a Mayor and Commonalty plead that they are ſeized in Fée,<note place="margin">Leo. 1. 153.</note> they néed not ſay in Right of their Corporation, the Name ſhews them to be a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it néed not be alledged.</p>
               <p>An Action there brought by the Guardians and Fellowſhip of <hi>Weavers;</hi> the Book ſaith,<note place="margin">Hob. 211.</note> That they néed not ſet themſelves out to be incorporate, the Name ſhews it ſo of Cities, ſaith the Book.</p>
               <p>So then, when the Writ is brought againſt a Mayor and Commonalty, or Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens, the Law takes notice of them to be a Corporation, and the Writ againſt them as ſuch; the Name ſhews it.</p>
               <p>But againſt Inhabitants of a Village, a Writ brought by the Name that cannot be taken to be other than Inhabitants, the Name ſo ſhews it; and in ſuch Caſe, ſome of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by Name <hi>(viz.) A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> appear in Perſon, in their own, and Names of the reſt of the Inhabitants, and plead, and are Defendants, <hi>Co. En. 537.</hi> So did they, as appears in that Precedent. No appearance ever was of Inhabitants in other manner.</p>
               <p>But in this Caſe here are no Perſons that do appear by Name, but the Corporation appear, and make an Attorney under their Common Seal. The Corporation, and no particular Perſons, are the Defendants before you, or elſe you have no Defendants before you; for there is none appearing in Perſon, here is no Defendant, nor none againſt whom you can give

               <p>Before I come to the matter, I would ſpeak to the Pleading herein, and in the ſubſequent Surrejoinder: And for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it, I think it is as ſingular and unpreſidented as the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it is.</p>
               <p>This Replication, ſuppoſing the matter had been the Act of the Body Politick, and good and ſufficient, yet, as pleaded, is inſufficient, and not warrantable by any Law or Practice ever known. It contains,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> An Iſſue, <hi>viz.</hi> no Corporation time out of mind.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Two Cauſes of Forfeiture of the Corporation, admitting they once were a Corporation.</p>
               <p>So that though the point in queſtion be but one, <hi>viz.</hi> whether we are lawfully a Corporation or no Corporation, though the Plea is ſingle, that we are a Corporation by Preſcription time out of mind, yet here is to try this point,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> An Iſſue.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> A double Plea, alleadging two Cauſes to avoid it for a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
               <p>This I conceive cannot legally be done, though in the King's Caſe. I do agree, the King hath great Prerogatives in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103424:36"/> and as far as ever they have been allowed or enjoyed, let them be ſo ſtill; but that the King can to the ſame matter both take Iſſue, and alſo plead over at the ſame, that I deny.</p>
               <p>It is moſt reaſonable, that the Law ſhould be carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King's Rights; but on the other ſide, I think it is not reaſonable, that the Law ſhould admit or allow as legal any way of Proceeding that ſhould deſtroy or render the Subjects right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenſible, be his right as good as it may be. If ſo be that Mr. Attorney may both take Iſſue upon the Fact, and alſo plead over, I would, by your leave, ask how many Iſſues, and how many Pleas over the King's Attorney may have?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the King bring a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> or Writ of Right, or any other Action, the Defendant makes his Title, which is uſually done, by many Grants and Conveyances from one to another, to bring it to himſelf.</p>
               <p>May the King's Attorney now take as many Iſſues as facts iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuable, plead as many Pleas as he pleaſeth, and all this <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel?</hi> 'Tis true, that in this caſe Mr. Attorney hath aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only two Breaches, or Cauſes of Forfeiture; but he might, if he had pleaſed, by the ſame Reaſon, have aſſigned <hi>200.</hi> If this may be, Are we not all at Mr. Attorney's Mercy? If this may not be, then how many Pleas? Is it in Law defined?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In favorem Vitae</hi> a man may plead a ſpecial Plea, and plead alſo not guilty, but not ſeveral ſpecial Pleas; but that there is any ſuch Prerogative for Mr. Attorney, in Suits betwixt the King and his Subjects, I can find no Inſtance or Authority for it.</p>
               <p>For though it be true, as I have ſaid, that the King hath great Prerogatives in pleading, yet it is as true that this is not boundleſs; but that if in the King's Writs there be miſtakes, or his Writ or his Action miſconceived, he ſhall be bound by it in like manner as Subjects are or ſhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> againſt <hi>Strange,</hi> and in the ſame Book in my Lord <hi>Berkley</hi>'s Caſe,<note place="margin">Com. 84. a. 236. a</note> it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>That though the King hath many Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, concerning his Perſon, Debts, and Duties, yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law hath ſo admeaſured his Prerogative, that it ſhall not take away or prejudice the Inheritance of any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King hath a Prerogative that he may wave his Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and take Iſſue, or wave his Iſſue and demurre upon the Plea: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the ſame Book, <hi>he muſt doe it the ſame Term,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Com. fol. 236.</note> 
                  <hi>not in any other Term, for then he may doe it <hi>in infinitum,</hi> without end, and the Party hereby may loſe his Inheritance; and for that the Common Law will not ſuffer the King to have ſuch a Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the words of the Book.</p>
               <p>And in the point that this Prerogative muſt be made uſe of the ſame Term, and that the King's Attorney cannot vary in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Term, and wave his Iſſue, is <hi>13 E. 4. 8. Bro. Prer. 69. 28 H. 8. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:103424:36"/>
               <p>So in making Title to a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> he at the end of the Term waved his firſt Title, and made another.</p>
               <p>But it is true alſo,<note place="margin">Rex verſ. Bagſhaw. Cr. 1. 347.</note> that as to the point of Waving Demurrers, and taking Iſſue in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Term, there is authority that he may ſo doe; but whether it may be done or not in another Term is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to our caſe: But the uſe I make of theſe Caſes is to prove that the King's Attorney ſhould not have both together <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> as in this caſe he hath done; he muſt wave one before he can have another Plea.</p>
               <p>For thoſe Debates about his varying his Plea by waving his Iſſue and demurring, or waving his Demurrer and taking Iſſue, ſignifie nothing, if he may in one Plea, and at the ſame time, take Iſſue, and demurre, or plead over to the ſame matter or point, as is done in this caſe; therefore thoſe Books ſtrongly prove, that the Prerogative that the King hath is by waving or relinquiſhing one, and chuſing the other; and therefore not to have or uſe all together and at once, as is done in this caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King ſhall be bound by one Iſſue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 H. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>he ſhall not have divers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as this Replication is at the ſame time <hi>ſimul &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> to the ſame matter, to take Iſſue that we were not a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration time out of mind, and to plead two matters of Fact for Forfeiture, is the firſt attempt that ever was of this kind, and in its conſequence confounding the right of the Subject, and leaves him perhaps only but a colour of Law, but moſt difficult, if not impoſſible by it to be defended, let his Right be what it will, if Iſſues and Pleas without number may be by the King's Attorney joined and pleaded, and the Subject muſt anſwer, the very charge beſides will undoe the Subject, and wreſt him out of his Eſtate by the Law that ſhould preſerve him. This point, if I miſtake not, will deſerve conſideration, if it be new, and the firſt project (for ſo I beg leave to call it) of its kind, for I know no Book or Inſtance of the like, unwarrantable by old Laws and Rules of Pleading. The old Laws and ways are good and ſafe,
<q>Eventos varios Res nova ſemper habet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps the conſequence and miſchiefs attending this way of joining Iſſue, and at the ſame time pleading over as many Pleas as Mr. Attorney pleaſeth, are as great as any other in this caſe, and not leſs to be minded or regarded. As of the one ſide great are the King's Prerogatives, and moſt neceſſary to be preſerved, and maintained; ſo it cannot be denied but that the Law hath ſet Limits and bounds, which muſt be kept and obſerved in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which is the Method and Mean of preſerving and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Rights, without which no man can be preſerved by the Law.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:103424:37"/>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that ſeveral Cauſes or Forfeitures may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, yet they muſt be all Facts done at the ſame time, or they confound one the other; for if the firſt Fact was a Forfeiture, thereby the Corporation was determined, and at an end, and the ſubſequent could not be the Act of the true lawfull Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that was forfeited, determined, and gone, by the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Forfeiture: And if ſo, that it was forfeited and gone by the precedent Act, <hi>viz.</hi> the making the Ordinance <hi>Septemb. 17. 26 C. 2.</hi> Then how could it act and forfeit it ſelf ſix years after, in the Year Thirty two? This ſeems impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But to avoid this:</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney in his Argument doth hold, That though the Act be a Forfeiture, yet till there be a Iudgment, or ſomething on Record to determine the Corporation, (and in this caſe the Iudgment to be given ſhall doe that Work,) till ſuch Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Corporation remains. Then taking it as Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney will have it, and as the truth is, ſuppoſing a Forfeiture, untill that Forfeiture appear on Record, or that there be ſome Office or Inquiſition that finds it, and that return'd, and on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, were it of any Eſtate in Lands, Tenements, Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Offices, it is not determined or veſted in the King, but continues. This is quite contrary and contradictory to all that you have done, and the very Foundation of this <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto;</hi> for if you admit, as then you do, that the Forfeiture <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> did not determine, but that it muſt be this <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> or Iudgment upon it, that muſt determine the Corporation, and that the Corporation, notwithſtanding ſuch Act, was or is in being; then they have not uſurped upon the King; they are the ſame Corporation they were; they have the ſame power to act they had; they have the ſame Warrant and Right they had, only ſubject to a Iudgment againſt them, that may be given hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for a Fact already paſt; for ſince that an Vſurpation is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wrongfull uſing a Liberty or Franchiſe upon the King, without lawfull Authority. Then</p>
               <p>Suppoſing ſuch an Act of Forfeiture doth not <hi>ipſo Facto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine or diſſolve, but a Iudgment, or ſome other Act of Record, muſt firſt be had, before ſuch diſſolution; then till ſuch Iudgment, or Act of Record, they are lawfully a Corporation in being, and their lawfull Warrant remains, and they did not, nor could ſo long uſurp their Being, and then hereby is your own Information deſtroyed and abated: For there you ſay that they did by the ſpace of a month, without any Warrant, uſe and uſurp the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be a Corporation. But hereby you grant that it was not uſed unlawfully, nor uſurped, but notwithſtanding the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture the Corporation lawfully continued, unleſs there had been ſome Iudgment, or other Act on Record to determine it.</p>
               <p>This I reſt upon as impoſſible to be avoided.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible that a Corporation or Body Politick can at the ſame time be lawfully and rightfully ſuch, and not lawfully and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103424:37"/> rightfully ſuch? Can right and wrong be the ſame? Can the ſame thing rightfully be or have its Being, and at the ſame time not rightfully be or have its being? Can we poſſibly be at the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> the time mentioned in the Information, a lawfull Corporation, and yet an uſurped or unlawfull Corporation? Could we then have a lawfull and rightfull Authority to be a Corporation, and at the ſame time have no lawfull or rightfull authority to be ſo?</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeem to be contradictions, and if ſo, are the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of all things to be believed or impoſed; therefore to be plain in this matter, either tell us that we are yet till Iudgment a Corporation or Body Politick lawfully and rightfully, or not. If you ſay we are, then as yet we are no unlawfull Corporation, nor have uſurped to be one, as in your Information and Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation you have alleadged. We have not then unlawfully taken upon us to be a Corporation, and therefore cannot have Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us, or be fined for having or being that which we lawfully have or be, as you now admit we are, conſequently you muſt go ſome other way, you have deſtroyed your own Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can have no Iudgment upon it.</p>
               <p>But perhaps this conceſſion of Mr. Attorney, that the old and lawfull Corporation and Body Politick is ſtill in being, and ſhall ſo continue, till by Iudgment or Matter on Record determined, may only be ſome ſudden thoughts; for not only the Matter, but the whole Proceedings in this Suit being at leaſt unexperienced, and perhaps much out of practice, it might eaſily happen, that in an haſty Proceedings all things might not be thought on, nor all the Objections or Inconveniencies foreſeen, and perhaps the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Poſition, that a Miſcarriage, or doing an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Act, ſhould <hi>ipſo facto</hi> forfeit the Body Politick or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might make a man ſtart, and caſt about how to avoid it, and flying from one danger run into another. Theſe are things ordinarily happening, and perhaps have in this caſe happened, and were the cauſe of this confeſſion, that the old and lawfull Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is yet in being, which is contrary to the whole frame and ſcope of both the Information and Replication, and probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought on or intended when the Information or Replication was made, being quite contrary and inconſiſtent with the frame and foundation of them both,</p>
               <p>If it be holden according to this conceſſion, that the old and lawful Corporation was not by the ſuppoſed Acts of Forfeiture diſſolved and determined <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but remained and continued lawfully a Corporation, and yet is ſo; then we have not uſurped, but are a lawful Corporation during the time in the Information, and not as therein ſuppoſed by Vſurpation, and without law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and thereby the Information confounded and abated.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:103424:38"/>
               <p>But ſuppoſing, according to what the Information and Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuppoſe,</p>
               <p>That the Acts of Forfeiture did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolve and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Corporation, for they will (at laſt I doubt) come to that again; for this preſent thought that it ſhall be forfeit, but not diſſolved or determined till Iudgment, will be ſubject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſame inconveniencies; for when Iudgment given, the Forfeiture muſt relate to the time of Offence, and to avoid all mean Acts as in other Caſes it doth.

               <p>That after the Burning and Rebuilding <hi>London,</hi> and the alterations thereby made, Controverſies did ariſe within the City concerning the Markets and the Tolls. That thereupon Sir <hi>William Hooker,</hi> then Mayor, and the Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Common-Council aſſembled, did make an Ordinance, Entituled, <hi>An Act for the Settlement and well ordering the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Publick Markets within the City.</hi> By which reciting, That whereas for accommodation of Market-people, with Stalls and Neceſſaries for their ſtandings, for clenſing and paving the ſame, for defraying incident Charges about the ſame, reaſonable Rates had always béen paid. To the end the Rates to be paid might be aſcertained, That the Market-people might know what to pay, and the Officers what to take; to avoid extortion, it was ordered there ſhould be paid by the Market-people for their Stalls, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Accommodations in the Markets,</p>
               <p>For every Horſe-load of Proviſion under publick ſhelter <hi>2 d.</hi> a day; for every Doſſer <hi>1 d.</hi> a day; for every Cart-load drawn with not above thrée Horſes <hi>3 d.</hi> a day; with more Horſes <hi>4 d.</hi> a day, and upon refuſal to pay to be removed. Then they aver that theſe Rates are reaſonable. That they are all the Rates that are paid by ſuch Market-people to the uſe of the City. That theſe Rates they have received ſince the making theſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That there is no other Ordinance for raiſing Moneys for ſuch Proviſions expoſed to Sale in their Markets in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner made.</p>
               <p>To this Rejoinder Mr. Attorney hath ſur-rejoyned, and taken it by Proteſtation, That the City were not ſeiſed of the Markets, nor at their own Coſts provided Stalls and other accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that the Rates by the Ordinance appointed were not reaſonable. For Plea ſets ſorth, An Act of Parliament made <hi>22 Car. 2.</hi> Enacting, <hi>That to the end apt and convenient Places within the City ſhould be put out for Buildings, and keeping the Markets;</hi> and that the <hi>Royal Exchange, Old-Baily,</hi> and common Gaols and Priſons within the City ſhould be made more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the enabling the City to do theſe things, they ſhould have a Duty out of Coals imported betwixt <hi>May 1670.</hi> and <hi>Mich. 1687.</hi> into the Port of <hi>London, 12 d. per</hi> Chaldron; which Duty they have accordingly received, amounting to a great Summ, and notwithſtanding that Duty, without Title or Right, the Defendants made the By-Law for their private Gain, <hi>abſ<expan>

               </p>
               <p>Vpon his Pleadings the Queſtions are, Whether the matters alledged by the Defendants, in Iuſtification of the Ordinance, or By-Law, be a good Iuſtification in Law or not. If it be, Mr. Attorney in his Sur-rejoinder hath given no anſwer to it at all, he hath neither confeſſed it, nor denied it. The Rejoynder ſaith, That the Defendants are and always have béen ſeiſed of the Markets in Fée.</p>
               <p>That they at their Charge provided Market-places, Stalls, Standings, and Officers for the accommodations of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and cleanſing them. That for defraying thoſe Charges they have always had divers reaſonable Tolls and Rates for Standings and other accommodations. That the Common-Council have, as often as expedient, always made Ordinances for regulating thoſe Markets, and for aſſeſſing and reducing to certainty reaſonable Tolls, Rates and Summs of Money to be paid by the Market-people for their accommodations.</p>
               <p>That according to this Cuſtom, they made the Ordinance and by-Law,</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney in his Sur-rejoinder hath not denied any part of this; but offers a traverſe to that which is no where alledged or ſuppoſed. It is never pretended that the City have had time out of mind the very Tolls and Summs of Money for Toll aſſeſſed by the Ordinance. There is not a word in the Rejoinder to that purpoſe, but to the contrary; <hi>(viz.)</hi> That they in their Rejoynder claim a Power by Ordinance of Common-Council to aſſeſſe and ſet the Rates of theſe Tolls and Payments as often as and when to them ſhall ſeem expedient. It is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Rejoinder, that theſe Summs were not time out of mind, only they had Power to ſett, and aſſeſs, and aſcertain, as often as expedient. Therefore when Mr. Attorney traverſeth our having time out of mind the Tolls, Rates and Summs of Money by the Ordinance aſſeſſed, and <hi>in certitud' reduct'</hi> This is plain, beſides any thing claimed or pretended unto, If he had intended to traverſe what we have alledged, that we have had time out of mind divers reaſonable Tolls &amp; Summs of Money for Stalls and Accommodations: Or if he would have traverſed the Inſtance alledged for the Common Council aſſeſſing thoſe Tolls, as often as expedient, that was plain and eaſie to doe; but that he hath not done: He hath only traverſed whether the Tolls, Rates, and Summs of Money, by the Ordinance aſſeſſed, and reduced into certainty, have been time out of mind. This is the proper ſenſe of his Traverſe, but if doubtfull in its
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103424:39"/> ſenſe, his Traverſe is naught for that cauſe; for dubious words can make no Iſſue for the Iury to try, elſe men ſhould be tricked and enſnared by doubtful words to pervert right. So that if the matter alledged in the Record, be ſufficient in Law to juſtifie the making this Ordinance, or By-Law; then what is done therein by the Act of Common-Council is lawfully and rightfully done, and no Forfeiture. I do agrée, that for a Lord of a Market to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to have a Toll uncertain, and as often as expedient, to aſcertain it is no good Preſcription.</p>
               <p>But that is not our Caſe; I do diſtinguiſh betwixt that and this Caſe: Where there is by Cuſtom, confirmed by Acts of Parliament, (for I ſhall ſhew that they are Acts of Parliament, notwithſtanding what hath béen objected againſt them,) a Power and Authority veſted in the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council, to regulate and order the People, Trades and Markets in the City, and the Places and Conveniencies and Officers from time to time, and conſequently to regulate and aſcertain the Tolls or Rates to be paid by the Market-people, to prevent Extortion and Diſorders.</p>
               <p>That ſuch Cuſtom is legal. The <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London<hi>'s</hi>
                  </hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Ordinance that no Broadcloth ſhall be ſold in the City before it be brought to <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> to be ſearched,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rep. 5. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>and a Penny for every Cloth to be paid for Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, under pain for forfeiting 6 s. 8 d. a Cloth, to be recovered in the City Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though objected that this was an Impoſition of payment of Money upon the King's Subjects, yet adjudged good, and a <hi>Procedendo</hi> granted,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Ordinance that no Unfreeman ſhall uſe a Trade in <hi>London,</hi> adjudged good.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A multitude of Ordinances they have for regulating all manner of Trades, and of Rates and Prizes. And as much reaſon there is to object againſt them, as this Ordinance, or the Cuſtom in this Caſe: But the City of <hi>London</hi> have a Government and Power of making Ordinances, for governing and regulating Trades, buying and ſelling within the City, placed in the Common-Council, and confirmed by Act of Parliament; and therefore not like the Caſe of any private Lord of a Market. But 'tis true, their Ordinances muſt not be unreaſonable. The Payments that are impoſed by this Ordinance, are only impoſed upon thoſe that are under ſhelter; 'tis reaſon a recompence ſhould be paid, and there is no unreaſonableneſs or injuſtice appears in the Ordinance, but a reaſonable recompence. But the Cuſtom or Power of the Common-Council is not denied, as I take it: For, they have not denied the Power to regulate and aſcertain the Tolls or Summs of Money alledged to be in the 5Common-Council, if they had, that muſt have been tryed: Nor have they denied the Rates ſet to be reaſonable. So that I think as to this matter, we have well entitled our ſelves, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103424:40"/> juſtified our making our By-Law, and taking the Tolls or Rates thereby appointed; and nothing in the Surrejoinder againſt us to the contrary objected.</p>
               <p>But for confirming and making good our Cuſtoms, in the Plea there are thrée Acts of Parliament pleaded.</p>

               <p>In the Replication 'tis alleadged, That a Parliament the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> was prorogued to the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi> That the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in their Common Council aſſembled, <hi>malitioſe, adviſate &amp; ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſe,</hi> took upon them <hi>ad judicand' &amp; cenſand'</hi> the King, and the Prorogation of the Parliament by the King ſo made; and that the Mayor, and Commonalty, and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> ſo in the ſaid Common Council aſſembled, did give their Votes and Order, That a Petition, in the Name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in Common Council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, ſhould be exhibited to the King. In which Petition it was contained, That by that Prorogation the proſecution of the publick Iuſtice of the Kingdom, and the making neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the Preſervation of the King, and his Proteſtant Subjects had received Interruption. And that the Mayor, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in Common Council as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid aſſembled, did malitiouſly, and ſeditiouſly, to the intent the ſame ſhould be diſperſed among the King's Subjects, and to cauſe an Opinion that the King obſtructed the publick Iuſtice, and to ſtir up Hatred and Diſlike againſt the King's Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did order the ſaid Petition to be printed, and afterwards they did print it, and cauſed it to be publiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Defendents in their Rejoinder to this Breach ſet forth and alleadg,<note place="margin">Rejoinder as to the Petition.</note> That there was a Plot againſt the Life of the King, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

The Proceedings in the Parliament towards the Tryall of the Lords, and preparing Bills to be enacted into Laws, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the King and his Subjects againſt theſe Plots and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies.

And thereupon the Mayor, and Aldermen, (naming them) and Commons in Common Council aſſembled, from their Hearts truly loyal to the King, and for the ſatisfaction of the Citizens, who had exhibited that Petition, and of intent to preſerve the Perſon of the King, and his Government, did give their Votes, and order a Petition ſhould be exhibited to the King in the Name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council aſſembled, and ſet forth the Petition in the Name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in Common Council aſſembled <hi>in haec verba:</hi>

To this part of the Rejoinder, Mr. Attorney hath demurred generally by the Demurrer, the Fact alleadged in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is admitted to be true. And it is true, that there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103424:43"/> are no words, that are written or ſpoken, but are ſubject to various Conſtructions: But I take it that no words, whether written or ſpoken, ought to be taken in an ill ſenſe, if they may reaſonably be taken in a better, <hi>Nemo prefumitur eſſe malus;</hi> and therefore the words muſt ſtand as they are penn'd: and having firſt expreſſed their Feats, and next their Hopes, from the King and Parliaments procéedings in Trial of thoſe that were Impeached, and making Laws for their Security, and how they were ſurprized at the Prorogation, then they ſay, That by that Prorogation, the proſecution of the publick Iuſtice of this Kingdom, and the making neceſſary proviſions for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King and his Proteſtant Subjects had received Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It is mentioned only as a conſequence of the Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, 'tis not ſaid or expreſſed that the King did interrupt, for I think there is great difference betwixt the one ſort of expreſſion and the other. An ill Conſequence may attend a good, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and moſt neceſſary Act; but no Conſequences can make an ill Act good; and therefore the expreſſing the Conſequence, doth not neceſſarily condemn or declare the Act to be an ill Act. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in the time of the great Plague a man had had a Suit in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> wherein all his Eſtate had béen concerned, and had ſaid or writ, That by the adjournment of the Terms by the King, the Procéedings of the Courts of Iuſtice in his Suit had received an Interruption, had theſe words béen puniſhable? The adjournment was then the moſt neceſſary and commendable Act that could be for the preſervation of the King's Subjects in that raging Peſtilence: and the Act it ſelf being ſo good and neceſſary, though there were ſuch Conſequence as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Suit, the writing or ſaying that it had ſuch a Conſequence, ſuch an Interruption, did not, I conceive, condemn, judge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare or expreſs the Act to be ill. Suppoſe a man had had a Bill depending in that Parliament to be Enacted for the enabling him to ſell his Land to pay his Debts, to free him from a Gaol: Or, ſuppoſe that ſome one of the Lords impeached in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had made a Petition for the Sitting of the Parliament, and had therein expreſſed as a reaſon and ground of his Petition, the like words as in this Petition. What would the Court have judged of it, are not the Caſes much the ſame? if they are, there will be no diſtinction of perſons in Iudgment; I am ſure there ought nor. Perhaps when this Petition was made, there might be too much heat in the minds of men, and it is true, that heat encreaſeth heat, and fire kindles fire; 'tis time for all ſorts to grow cool and temperate, and to weigh and conſider we are or ſhould be conſidering men. This Petition was made <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> and undoubtedly among ſuch a number as the Common Council, there muſt be men of variety of Tempers and Diſpoſitions: But for the greateſt number of the Aldermen and Common Council, think of them, we know the men, many of them; can we imagine that they had either the leaſt ill thought
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103424:43"/> or meaning towards the King, his Perſon, or Government, in this Petition, or the printing it. And as for the printing it, that, my Lord, ſtands upon the ſame Reaſons and Grounds: For if there be nothing ill or unlawfull in it contained, then the printing and publiſhing of that which contains nothing ill or unlawfull, is not, as I conceive, ill or unlawfull. Printing is but a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious way of Writing, and is good or bad as the matter printed is good or bad. The Defendants in their Rejoinder have ſet forth their whole caſe, the Reaſons and Grounds of what the Common Council did, and the manner and intent of their doing it; all which Fact cannot be denied to be true, but is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Demurrer. It hath not, nor can be ſaid, but it is well pleaded, and might have been traverſed and denied if not true: But it is confeſſed by the Demurrer to be true, and therefore that muſt be taken to be the Fact, and not as alleadged in the Replication, and then ſo taken, I ſubmit it to your Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>(3.) But the next thing conſiderable is, Whether, ſuppoſing and admitting, that if done by the Body Politick, it had been a Miſcarriage, or a Crime, whether, not being done by the Body Politick, nor under the Common Seal, but by Common Council, whether thereby the Being of the Corporation ſhall be forfeit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Common Council in Corporations is generally a ſelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Body corporate, conſtituted to adviſe and aſſiſt the Corporation in their ordinary affairs and buſineſs. There is no certain Rule nor Meaſure of their Power, wherein all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councils agree. In ſome Corporations the Common Council have greater authority, in ſome leſs, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral authorities by the reſpective Charters where the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are by Charters; or by Cuſtome, or Vſage, where the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations are by Preſcriptions: But in all they are a ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of Men, conſtituted and authoriſed for particular ends and purpoſes. And in this caſe I think the Court can take notice of the Common Council no otherwiſe than upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord they appear to be. The Replication doth not ſay what they are, but would go in the dark, by intention and preſumption, the beſt way and method to arbitrary Determination. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder ſaith, that the Citizens and Freemen are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fifty thouſand, and more. That there hath been time out of mind a Common Council, conſiſting of the Mayor, and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the time being, and of certain Freemen, not exceeding <hi>250,</hi> annually elected to ſerve as Common Council-Men, and are called the Commons of the City. That time out of mind there hath been a Cuſtome, that the Mayor, Aldermen, and ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſo elected to be of the Common Council, according to cuſtom, have been accuſtomed to make By-Laws and Ordinances, for the better regulation of the publick Markets, for appointing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103424:44"/> times and places, and aſſeſſing and reducing into certainty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Tolls, Rates, and Summs of Money, payable for Stalls and Standings, in the Market. For any things appears upon the Record, this is all they have power to doe: <hi>Non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat</hi> to the Court that they have any other power or authority over Lands, Eſtates, or any thing elſe. Next, If this which in the Rejoinder is alleadged, of the Being and Power, be true, and ſo admitted, then what they did in making the Ordinance, was done by good and lawfull power and authority, and then can be no Offence: But if to make the Ordinance be an Offence, and an unlawfull Act, you deny the Cuſtom to be good, and ſay, the Cuſtome is void, and againſt Law, and for that Reaſon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance illegal. Then <hi>non conſtat</hi> that they had any power at all to doe any thing, and then a Common Council to adviſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power to doe any Act: and if ſo, How can a parcel or part of a Corporation, not authoriſed to doe any Act, doe an Act that ſhall forfeit? Suppoſe a particular Company, as the Mercers, had done this, could this be a Forfeiture? But if to avoid this you will ſay, that the Court ſhall take notice of the Common Council of <hi>London,</hi> to have the management of the buſineſs of the Corporation belonging to them. This I think the Court cannot doe, and I cannot ſee how poſſibly they can, as a Court, judicially take notice hereof. Suppoſe our Queſtion had been concerning another Corporation, could the Court then, as a Court, judicially have taken notice of the Power or Authority of their Common Council. Mr. Sollicitor in his Argument held, That there was no difference betwixt <hi>London</hi> and another Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, except that <hi>London</hi> was the biggeſt. Then put the caſe of any other Corporation, could the Court judicially have taken notice of their Power or Intereſt, without having it ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet forth? Is it poſſible the Court can, ſince they differ one from the other, as much as their Charters or Conſtitutions do differ, of which there is hardly to be found two in <hi>England</hi> that do agree in their Powers? If it had been of another Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of neceſſity the conſtitution of the Common Council muſt have been ſet forth. If you are upon a By-law, made by any other than the Body Politick it ſelf, muſt not the Power and Authority of thoſe that made it, be ſhewn, and ſet forth in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in any caſe where there is occaſion to uſe it? How other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could the Court judge or determine of it? So that taking the Law to be as the other ſide ſaith, that <hi>London</hi> differs not from any other Corporation; it is no where alledged in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they have Power to make By-Laws, for the ordering and governing the City, or that they can bind all the Corporation in ſale or diſpoſition of their Lands, or have the power of the common Seal: Therefore when the King's Counſel argue from theſe Powers, their Power of forfeiting, they argue quite out of the Record; they have no where alleadged or pleaded what they are, or what Power they have, as they ſhould have done, if they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103424:44"/> had ſo intended. So as to this particular here is nothing before the Court, nothing upon Record, to ſhew how or which way the Body Politick ſhould be concerned in theſe Acts of about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of their Members, called the Common Council. Whereſoever any By-Laws or Ordinances are pleaded, the Power to make theſe By-Laws or Ordinances is pleaded, and ſo are all particular and derived Authorities, whenever occaſion to plead them, and neceſſary they ſhould be ſo: For 'tis Fact that the other ſide may and ought to be at liberty to deny it, if he ſée cauſe; and therefore if they will have it that the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have abuſed ſome Power or Authority they have, thereby to forfeit the Corporations, they ought to have ſhewn it; to ſay that notice ſhall be taken, or it ſhall be intended or preſumed, is in truth a Preſumption upon the Court, as if the Court ſhould take notice of intend or preſume what the King's Counſel would have, which the Court cannot, nor will doe, more in this than in other caſes. But ſuppoſing the Court will take more notice of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> than any other Corporation, and will take notice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council there, and of their Power and Authority; and I will ſuppoſe as the other ſide do, That they have the Power of making By-Laws, of leaſing, granting, and managing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lands and Revenues, and of ſealing with the common Seal, and that this they have by Cuſtome; Then ſurely, ſay the other ſide, they have the Power of ſurrendring and forfeiting the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. If I ſhould anſwer, ſurely and without doubt they have not, this would not argue they have not; but the Argument ſhould come of the other ſide, to prove they have; they have not, nor can produce any Caſe or Opinion to prove it; and the very thought that they could is ſo new, that I believe none can be found like it. But let us conſider the nature of this Thing a little par, ticularly, though general Diſcourſes are moſt eaſie and florid-yet perhaps a particular Enquiry may beſt diſcover. Admit that they have the Power the other ſide ſay they have; yet they are not the Corporation, but a part conſtituted for theſe particulars ends and purpoſes for which they are impowered. Corporations had their Creations by Charter; that gives them their Being, and the Form, Method, and Power of Action. Suppoſe that the firſt Charter of Incorporation that was granted to <hi>London</hi> did grant, that the Citizens ſhould be incorporate, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, by the Name of Mayor, and Commonalty, and Citizens, that there ſhould be a Mayor, ſo many Aldermen, and ſo many of the Citizens, annually elected, that ſhould be a Common Council, and that they ſhould have Power to make By-Laws, to demiſe or grant their Lands, under the common Seal, in the name of the Corporation. If they doe any Act not within their Commiſſion, is not that void? Suppoſe a Grant made to the Common Council, would not that be void? Suppoſe a Grant made by the Common Council in the name of the Common Council under Seal, or in the name of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103424:45"/> but not under Common Seal; is not all this void? This I only inſtance, to ſhew that their Charter and Authority is their Power and Warrant, they are to act by; did ever any man hear of, or ſée a Charter giving the Common Council power to Surrender the Corporation? or was it ever thought of before theſe days? If then no ſuch power by the Charter given, if they cannot doe it without power given them, ſhew me their power, or elſe I think I may conclude ſure they cannot Surrender the Corporation without power. But the Common Council in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> that is by Cuſtom, and their power is by Cuſtom. Then if the Queſtion be, what is their power? it is anſwered, what they have uſed and accuſtomed to doe, that they may doe; what they have not uſed or accuſtomed to doe, that they cannot doe: for if Cuſtom and Vſage be the authority, that authority can go no farther than their Cuſtom and Vſage goes. Then put the Queſtion, have the Common Council uſed to Surrender or Forfeit the Charter, no body can ſay it; what reaſon then is there for any man, to ſay they can doe it? It is probable that the Common Council in <hi>London,</hi> had firſt their Inſtitution from ſome By-Law or Ordinance, though now not to be produced, but conſumed by time. But be it that, or any other imagined Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, can it be imagined that thoſe that gave them their Original authority, gave them power to ſurrender the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or forfeit it. Suppoſe that the power given them did au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize them not only to make By-Laws and Ordinances for the good order and government of the Corporation, to grant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their Lands and Revenues, but had ſome general words in it to act and manage the matters of the Corporation. Is it not againſt all ſenſe to ſuppoſe that that which is deputed and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the well-ordering and managing of the Corporation ſhould have power to ſurrender it. Then as the Counſel of the other ſide argue, that becauſe they may ſurrender they may forfeit: By the ſame reaſon, I hope I may argue, if they cannot ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or diſpoſe of the Corporation, they cannot forfeit. Next, Thoſe Acts of the Common Council are not done neither in the name, nor as the Acts of the Corporation, nor under any Seal; but do import in themſelves only to be the Acts of the Common Council. The Ordinance, That is made by the Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Commons in Common Council aſſembled. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is the Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Council aſſembled. Their Leaſes or Grants are in the names of the Corporations, and under the Common Seal and the Common Council only Miniſterial to the Corporation in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, managing and diſpoſing all for the benefit and advantage of the Corporation, to avoid the Inconveniency of aſſembling the numerous Body. But that any thing that hath but a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power for the ſervice and benefit of their principal, ſhould have power to diſpoſe of, ſell, convey or ſurrender, and deſtroy their principal, is no conſequence in Law or Reaſon. No Deputy-aſſiſtant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103424:45"/> or Bayliff hath ſuch power, if he excéed his authority, his Act is void. Is it not ſo with all Authorities and derived Powers? what they doe beyond their authority cannot bind thoſe from whom they derive it. It cannot be the Act of the Corporation, for a Corporation cannot make a Petition, no more than they can make a Déed, or ſubſcribe a Writing, except under the common Seal.</p>
               <p>Corporations cannot make a Leaſe at will,<note place="margin">12 H. 7. 25, 26. 9 E. 4. 39.</note> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence a Man to enter upon their Lands, or doe any like Act, but under their common Seal. Nor can they commit a Treſpaſs or Diſſeiſin but by Command pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or Aſſent ſubſequent under their common Seal. How then can this be their Act? There is nothing in it that imports it ſhould be theirs, nor ever intended to be theirs; it is not done by them, nor in their names, but by the Common Council, and in the name of the Common Council. If we may take notice of what is out of the Record, we know that they have in <hi>London</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſſembly than the Common Council, <hi>viz.</hi> The Common Hall, wherein the Common Council are no more than others. Can the Petition of the Mayor, or Mayor and Aldermen, in their names be taken to be the Act of the Corporation? if that cannot be, why ſhould the Petition of the Common Council in their own names be any other than their own Petition, as their Ordinance and By-Law theirs, and not the Corporations.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Corporations takes notice of their Power, as Common Councils,<note place="margin">Rep. 4.77.</note> to exclude the Commonalty and the reſt of the Corporation.<note place="margin">13 C. 2. cap. 5.</note> The Act allows the Common Councils ordering Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But where is it to be found that it was ever ſaid or thought on before, that they could forfeit or diſſolve the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>(4.)

               </p>
               <p>This I call the great Point, for I think it to be as great in Conſequence as ever any at this Barr, as if <hi>Magna Charta</hi> were at ſtake; for in my apprehenſion, not only <hi>London,</hi> but all the Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> and the Government of <hi>England</hi> will be deeply concerned in the Queſtion.

Perhaps the World it ſelf, at leaſt this little World, will no longer be able to ſubſiſt in health than the due Order and juſt Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeveral Parts and Powers therein, are preſerved, and contain themſelves within their own Bounds. The taking away or Infeebling any principal Part brings a Lameneſs and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Pain and Diſorder upon, and at length confounds the whole. The Laws anſwer their ends, whereof the principal is the preſervation of the Government which preſerves the Laws, they cannot ſubſiſt one without the other; therefore whatſoever it is that tends to the Subverſion, or leaving at Will and Pleaſure that which is ſo conſiderable in our Government as Corporations are, ought to be throughly conſidered.</p>
               <p>The better to examine and conſider this great Point: In the firſt place, the Reaſons given on the other ſide are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 1. That if Corporations be not forfeitable for their Miſcarriages, they will attempt and doe extravagant Acts, raiſe Sedition or Rebellion, and there will be no adequate Puniſhment to their Miſcarriages.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> In anſwer to this Reaſon,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> There is no illegal Act that they can attempt or commit, but that they are under the ſame Severities and Corrections of Law as any other the King's Subjects not Incorporate are. Though it be true, that the Corporation it ſelf is only a Body Politick, an inviſible Body, yet the Members of it they are viſible. If they as Members of that Corporation commit or doe any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unlawful Act, they are puniſhable for it in their own private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. If they make any Ordinance or By-Law to raiſe Money unlawfully upon any of their Members, or others, the By-Law or Ordinance is void. If they receive or collect any Money by it, the Receivers and Collectors are to anſwer it, they are to be ſued as any other Subject. Suppoſe a Lord of a Mannor or Market make an unlawful Order to collect or take Money from his Tenants or Coppyholders, or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tolls in his Markets. This Order is void in Law, and thoſe that collect or receive any Money by it, are anſwerable for it, and the Parties grieved have their proper Actions and Remedies, and perhaps the Markets, or at leaſt the Tolls may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103424:46"/> be ſieſed, or forfeit for this Miſcarriage. This is the Proviſion that by Law is made againſt ſuch Exactions, and this is juſt and adequate &amp; reaſonable. And if a Corporation make ſuch Ordinance, By-Law, or Order, and thereby there is the ſame receipt or Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Subject hath the ſame remedy, and there is the ſame Forfeiture of Toll or Market, as in caſe of any natural Perſon, or Lord of a Mannor, and the Proviſions by Law made are juſt and reaſonable, and adequate in this Caſe of the Corporation, as of the other. The like for any Offence that can be committed, it muſt be done by particular Members, and they muſt anſwer for it. And this is no new Opinion, <hi>21 E. 4. 14.</hi> expreſs that a Mayor and Commonalty, or other Body Politick, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon, although all the Commonalty doe commit Treaſon, every of them is a Traitor in his own perſon: I might cite other Authorities to this purpoſe, but they have béen already cited by Mr. Recorder in his Argument; and though the Counſel for the King would make theſe Books to be but ſome ſlight Opinions, yet unleſs they could ſhew ſome Authority, Book, or Caſe to the contrary, their deſpiſing or little valuing what they can find no Anſwer for, will not render the Authority and conſtant Opinions of our Books of leſs eſtéem than they ought to be. 'Tis no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe if they doe an unlawful Act, that they are Members of a Corporation, or did it as a Corporation. No body can ſay this will excuſe them; ſo, that notwithſtanding their being a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they are ſubject to the Law, be the Offence Treaſon, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or any other Crime or Offence as, any other the King's Subjects are; every particular Member that acted or committed that Offence, is anſwerable to the Law for it. The particular Members that commit the unlawful Act, and all that act under their Authority, are ſubject to the ſame Law as all other the King's Subjects. And therefore this reaſon, that elſe there will be no Puniſhment upon them adequate to the Offence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a Miſchief and Inconvenience is but a ſhadow, and nothing proportionable to the Miſchiefs and Inconveniences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the poſition of a Forfeiture of the other ſide. But conſider the Injuſtice that would be of the other ſide, if this ſhould be ſo; we know Aſſemblies determine their Act by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Vote, and great ſtruggling there is, as wée too frequently ſée in their Debates and Reſolutions, and carried by majority of one or two Votes, ſometimes by ſurprizes and undue management, ſometimes by fear and terror: Suppoſe an evil Act ſo carried or managed, is it reaſon that all the whole Corporation ſhould be hereby forfeit? and thereby all other men to whom they owe any Debts, muſt loſe them, and the many Intereſts and Livelyhoods depending upon the Corporation, the Cuſtoms, Courts, Offices, and Privileges belonging to it, endleſs to enumerate, ſhall all be undone and deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 2. The next Reaſon that hath been given is, That it is a general Rule in Law, that the abuſing or miſuſing of a Franchiſe, is a Forfeiture of the Franchiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp. 2.</hi> This is true in the ſenſe that the Books do ſay it; for if a man miſuſe or abuſe a particular Franchiſe, he ſhall forfeit that particular Franchiſe; but he ſhall not forfeit any other except it be depending upon and incident to it. And the Caſes cited prove nothing farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">22 Aſſ. p. 34. Br. Fran. 34.</note>That when a man hath divers Franchiſes not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending one upon another, and miſuſeth one Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, he ſhall not thereby forfeit the reſt, but only that which he miſuſeth.<note place="margin">8 H. 4. 18. Rep. 9. 96. b 24 E. 4. b Inſt. 2. 43.</note> And therefore the Caſes cited; Where the Abbat of <hi>Crowland</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of St. <hi>Albans</hi> had Franchiſes of Cuſtodies of Gaols; one would not be at the coſt of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Gaol-Delivery, the other did detain in Priſon after legal Diſcharge, and Fées paid. This was a miſuſer of thoſe Franchiſes and Forfeitures. So alſo perhaps if there be a Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe that hath Incidents to it; as, Pypowders to a Fair, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory to a Leet. An abuſer of the Incident, as the Court of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powders, or the not having a Pillory, may forfeit the Market or the Leet. If the Lord of a Market take outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Toll,<note place="margin">Stat. Weſt. 1. cap. 31. Inſt. 2. 219.</note> he ſhall forfeit the Market. But doth this prove, that if a Corporation have Fairs, Markets, Gaols, or Leets, and miſuſeth any of them, that the Body Politick, the Corporation ſhall be forfeit. If this be ſo, the Abbats, they being Corporations, in the caſes of the Abbat of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and <hi>Crowland,</hi> ſhould have forfeited not only the Liberties of having Gaols, but the very Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Bodies Politick, of being Abbats; a conceit never yet imagined. Can you ſay the City of <hi>London</hi> is either dependent or incident to the Markets; or the contrary, that the Markets are incident or dependent upon the Corporation, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be one without the other? Can this be ſaid? If this cannot be ſaid with reaſon, how can then the taking theſe Tolls admit they were outrageous, and a Forfeiture of the Market forfeit the Corporation? The making the Ordinance, ſuppoſing they made it, is but the mean by which they took it. Your Books only prove the abuſe of a Franchiſe, a Forfeiture of that Franchiſe, or Incidents to it, and no other: But the Inference in this Caſe is not the Forfeiture of that particular Franchiſe; but of the being of the Corporation that owned the Franchiſe: which is a plain <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> unleſs you ſay the Corporation is incident to the Market. Arguments from general Rules are the moſt fallible, eſpecially in Law; and that this is ſuch, I hope moſt plainly to ſhew in the diſtinguiſhing the different nature of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes; which I ſhall doe preſently, only taking in my way
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103424:47"/> their next Reaſon that they offer, and anſwer both together: which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 3. That a Corporation is a Franchiſe; that it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth by Grant, and therefore Forfeitable and Surrenderable as other Franchiſes are; and if they be Surrenderable, then alſo are they Forfeitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> I do agrée, that Franchiſe is a large word, it is of the like ſenſe of Liberty or Privilege. Therefore in <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> Franchiſes, Liberties, and Priviledges ſéem to be of the ſame ſenſe. To be a Subject born, and to have Liberty and Priviledge of a Fréeman, and no Villian, is a great Franchiſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Law, when a Villain is made Free, we ſay he is Infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, he hath the Franchiſe, Liberty and Priviledge of being a Fréeman. An Alien he is made Denizen by Letters Patents, a Perſon attainted is Pardoned by Letters Patents, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in blood granted and made a new Creature. By theſe Grants the Alien and the Perſon reſtored have ſuch Franchiſes Liberties and Privileges granted them: that though before they were not capable to take hold, or enjoy, or Act as natural born Subjects or Freemen, yet hereby they have ſuch Capacity granted: Next, I think it will be granted that this Franchiſe, Liberty, Privilege, or Capacity, is not ſurrenderable or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable, except only in Caſes of Treaſon or Felony, where they forfeit their Lives; by theſe inſtances this is proved, That it is no true poſition that whatſoever is grantable is ſurrenderable, and if ſurrenderable forfeitable; which is one of the Reaſons given by the King's Counſel, why a Corporation is forfeitable, for theſe Franchiſes or Privileges are by Grant, and yet not ſurrendera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or forfeitable; and this alſo ſhews that Arguments general and from general Rules are moſt fallible, and fit only to take weak apprehenſions. But next conſider, what it is to be a Body Politick or Corporation. A Body Politick is framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in ſimilitude or likeneſs of a natural body, with Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to take hold and enjoy, and act as a natural body, and can no more ſurrender or forfeit his being while the members of that Body are ſubſiſting, than a natural body can while alive. It is only a Capacity framed and created in a multitude to be, and act as one perſon, they are incorporate and made one Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick that have Power, and Capacity or Franchiſe of acting taking holding and granting; this is their Franchiſe, admit it ſo, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from others. Franchiſes and Liberties of all other Natures are Eſtates and Inheritances grantable and conveyable from one to another as other Eſtates are, this is no ſuch thing grantable or transferrable; other Franchiſes and Liberties affect the King's Subjects, and are Privileges claimed, wherein the King and the reſt of his Subjects not claiming the Franchiſe, are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than in this of being a Body Politick; for other Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103424:48"/> either convey ſome Profit from the King, as Felons, Goods, Waifs, Eſtrays, Wrecks, or the like: Or affect his Subjects, as Courts, Gaols, Returns of Writs, Fairs, Markets, and the like. But this of being a Body Politick, is only a Capacity to be a Perſon capable of having and holding what may be granted unto it; and of granting and acting as a natural Body, and affects the King, or other his Subjects, no otherwiſe than giving Capacity to take, hold and enjoy what they can get as other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons capacitated may. Other Franchiſes, Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges are diſtinct and ſeparate Eſtates, and if any one be forfeit, as it may for miſuſer, the reſt are not; except incidents and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances. But if the being of a Corporation be forfeited, All their Eſtates, Lands, Goods and Chattels are gone at once: So that though you admit and call this a Liberty or Franchiſe, 'tis nothing like in its nature to thoſe things generally known and underſtood by the name of Franchiſes or Liberties; and general Sayings are generally to be underſtood of ſuch things as are generally ſo taken and called. If then there be ſuch great and apparent difference betwixt this of the being a Body Politick, ſuppoſing it being in a general and large ſenſe, a Franchiſe, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or Privilege, and other particular Franchiſes, admitting that which is ſaid, that the Miſuſer of a Franchiſe is a Forfeiture, holds generally true, yet it is not in every particular true, where there is ſuch apparent difference and reaſon to diſtinguiſh as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the being of a Corporation or a Body Politick, which is only a Capacity, and other particular Franchiſes, which are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; there is alſo apparent reaſon to diſtinguiſh betwixt one and the other, they being ſo much differing one from the other in nature and reality. But next, That this was never taken in Law to be ſuch a Franchiſe, Liberty, or Privilege as was comprehended under the general meaning of Franchiſe or Liberty. By <hi>Sta. of Gloſt'</hi> Writs were to go to all She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs forty days before the Eire of general Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">6 E. 1. Inſt. 2. 278.</note> for all to come in at the Eire to claim their Privileges; and the ſecond day of the ſitting of the Iuſtices in Eire a Proclamation made to the ſame purpoſe. In the Comment upon that Statute it appears,<note place="margin">Inſt. 2. 281. 282.</note> that if the party did not appear, his Franchiſes were ſeiſed into the King's hands, <hi>Nomine diſtrictionis,</hi> and if not replevied ſitting the Eire, they were forfeit or loſt for ever. If the party did appear, and did not claim, then they were loſt for ever. In all the Procéedings in Eire, there is no ſuch thing can be found: That the Corporations did come in and make Claims to their being Corporations or Bodies Politick, or that ever any were ſeiſed if it be ſeiſable into the King's hands, or was forfeit for not Claiming. <hi>Fulher and Heyward's C. Palm. 491.</hi> It appears, that the Dean and Chapter there Surrendred their Charter, and all their Mannor Lands, Poſſeſſions, Privileges, Franchiſes and Hereditaments, Spiritual and Temporal, and this with intent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103424:48"/> to Surrender, that there might be a new Corporation erected; as is recited in the Letters Patents of new Erection. In this Caſe, <hi>Rep. 3. 75. And. 2. 120. Jones 168.</hi> reſolved, that by this Surrender the old Corporation was not ſurrendered. This Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth conclude, and muſt be given, either becauſe by the word Franchiſe, and the other general words, the Franchiſe of being a Corporation was not comprehended; or if the word's ſufficient, and did compriſe it, that it could not by Law be Surrendered. This I think ſufficiently ſhews that Corporations were in Law as Perſons natural are, and in like manner claimed, and that the being a Body Politick or Corporation, was not to be claimed, compriſed, or meant within the general words, Franchiſes, no more than the Liberty or Franchiſe of Denizen, or Manumiſſion. Next, No inſtance can be given of any ſeiſure of any Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Body Politick for any Forfeiture, Seiſure of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or putting Officers upon them, is quite another thing, as I ſhall ſhew preſently: So that theſe general Sayings in Law-Books, that Miſuſer of a Franchiſe forfeits the Franchiſe; neither in Law or Reaſon extends to the being of a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Corporation, but is applicable only to particular Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of other natures; and the other reaſon, that that which is grantable is forfeitable, is as fallacious as before appears.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. For the Records cited to prove that the Corporation or Body Politick may be Forfeited, I will ſtate thoſe that are moſt Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and doe them right therein.</hi>

               <p>The Statute <hi>28 E. 3. cap. 10.</hi> enacted, That the Mayor, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> which have the Governance of the ſame, ſhall cauſe the Errours, Defaults, and Miſpriſions in and about the ſame, to be corrected and redreſſed from time to time, upon pain, that is to ſay to forfeit to the King for the firſt Default one thouſand Marks, the ſecond Default two thouſand Marks, and for the third Default the Franchiſes and Liberties of the City ſhall be ſeiſed into the King's hands.

                  <hi>1.</hi> They were all above three hundred years ago, except that of <hi>16 R. 2.</hi> which is above two hundred and ninety, and no ſuch thing ever done ſince, what ſtreſs or weight can be given to ſuch Proceedings? To what Rules of Law, ſince known or practiſed, can we bring theſe Proceedings? Are they now legal Precedents for the like things to be done? The Writs out of old Records for the Ship-money, and the Knighthood-money, had as good Records to warrant them, and much more plain to the purpoſe than theſe. The Precedents of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, either of their Lives, or of their Deaths, or of the Lives or Deaths of ſome of the Iudges of thoſe days, ought, as I conceive, to be no Examples. And for <hi>H. 3. E. 1. E. 2.</hi> and <hi>R. 2.</hi> and thoſe times, they were times of great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſorders, and what was then done is no Rule or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for this Court, or any other Court of Iuſtice, to go by, unleſs by later times allowed or approved. No Law-book or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any judicial Proceedings, either of <hi>E. 2.</hi> or of <hi>E. 3.</hi> or any later Book of Law that I have yet heard of, or met with, (and I doubt not but if there had been any, the King's Counſel would have made uſe of them,) hath ever given ſo much credit or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to theſe Proceedings, as to take any notice of them. To make uſe of old Records or Precedents, the Grounds or Reaſons whereof cannot now be known, to ſubvert any Law or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed, is neither adviſable nor commendable. But for anſwer to them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> As to that of <hi>16 R. 2.</hi> that you ſee is grounded upon the Statute <hi>28 E. 3. c. 10.</hi> and can ſignifie nothing to the preſent purpoſe, for there, according to that Statute, they condemn the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen upon their Confeſſion, that they had miſgoverned the City. The Mayor and Sheriffs being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſons, and this done before Dukes and Earls, by ſpecial Commiſſion to that purpoſe appointed, and convicted by their confeſſion, for the firſt, ſecond, third Offenſe all at once, Is this of good Authority in Law? And for the others, that of <hi>E. 2.</hi> was before Iuſtices in Eire at the Tower, the Office of Mayoralty ſeiſed into the King's hands, and replevied from year to year. And that Seiſure that was made by King <hi>E. 1.</hi> for what Reaſons or Grounds, or by what ſort of Proceedings, doth not appear; all that doth appear of it is, that <hi>de facto Cuſtodes</hi> and Mayors were put upon the City, but <hi>quo jure</hi> who can tell. We know theſe times were times of trouble, in the Barons Wars.</p>
               <p>The Barons, <hi>Simon Mountford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> being their General,<note place="margin">48 H. 3.</note> faught a Battel with the King at <hi>Lewes,</hi> and took the King and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt both Priſoners.</p>
               <p>The Barons differing among themſelves,<note place="margin">49 H. 3.</note> and the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> joined with the Prince, who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103424:51"/> got out of Priſon, another Battel was fought at <hi>Eviſham,</hi> and the great Earl <hi>Mountford</hi> ſlain; and then at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament all his Party and the Liberties of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſeiſed, and in ſuch times as theſe, and which followed in <hi>E. 1. E. 2.</hi> and <hi>R. 2.</hi> it is not to be marvelled if there were many Seiſures and <hi>Cuſtodes</hi> put on the City, 'tis more a marvel they were not deſtroyed. The Statutes made in theſe times, ſhew not only the Diſorders, but that the Liberties mere greatly Infringed, or elſe there would not have béen Statutes to confirm them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Infringing or Seiſing were the Cauſe or Effect, is hard to know; but juſt before in thoſe times there were undoubtedly many extravagant Acts of all ſides, which produced <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> made the <hi>9 H. 3.</hi> for confirming of the Liberties and Privileges, not only of <hi>London,</hi> but of all other Towns: and after theſe times, in the thrée Reigns of the thrée ſuccéeding Kings, how many other Statutes for confirming the Liberties and Privileges of the Cities and Towns were made <hi>1 H. 4. cap. 15.</hi> The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties and Forfeitures impoſed by the Statute <hi>28 E. 3. cap. 10.</hi> upon the City of <hi>London</hi> put into the ſame Condition with other Cities and Boroughs as to Penalties and Seiſures.</p>
               <p>A Statute confirming to all the Cities and Boroughs, the Liberties and Franchiſes which they by former Grants or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations had, <hi>viz. 4 H. 4. Cap. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Confirmed in like manner, by <hi>7 H. 4. Cap. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again confirmed in like manner, by <hi>3 H. 5. cap. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again confirmed by Statute of <hi>2 H. 6. Cap. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appears what a ſenſe and memory they had of the Seiſures that had béen of their Liberties and Privileges, that they never thought them ſufficiently confirmed; but they were ſufficiently confirmed; for from the time of <hi>R. 2.</hi> to this day we do not find any Seiſure of any Liberties or Franchiſes, or <hi>Cuſtos</hi> made or put upon them. That which was in thoſe days of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done, ſhew them the worſt of times, but are no Precedents for the beſt. But next,</p>
               <p>Suppoſing and admitting theſe Records of theſe times of good Authority, and as authentick Precedents as can be, they are ſo far from proving againſt me, that I hope to make it moſt plainly to appear, that they are ſtrong and plain Authorities and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them, and for me.</p>
               <p>It is ordinary in Diſputing or Arguing to loſe the point diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or argued. That I may not commit ſo great an Error, but may evines and make plain what I have affirmed,</p>
               <p>Give me leave to look back to the Information and Replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from thenee to make the Points that we argue ſingle, clear and open.</p>
               <p>The Information that ſaith that we uſurp'd upon the King to be a Corporation and Body Politick, but in truth are none.</p>
               <p>The Barr ſets forth the title to be a Corporation by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion time out of mind.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:103424:51"/>
               <p>The Replication that endeavours to avoid the Bar, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we were once a Corporation lawfully; but that by our Miſcarriages, we have forfeited our being a Corporation, and thereby became none, and after that uſurp'd to be one.</p>
               <p>So that, that which the other ſide maintains, is, That by our miſ-feaſances we have committed a Forfeiture of our old lawfull and rightfull Corporation. This I deny; the Affirmation is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to prove, and they producing no Record that expreſſes any ſuch Forfeiture of a Corporation, but only Records gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſaying, that the Liberties ſhould be Forfeited or Seiſed, the queſtion is, what the meaning is in theſe old Records of Forfeiting and Seiſing Liberties. Mr. Attorney was pleaſed to take it, and ſo did Mr. Solicitor, as I think, that Forfeiting and Seiſing were much one. I ſhall not diſpute it; but whether in any of thoſe Records the Corporation or Body Politick were by theſe words taken to be forfeited. Mr. Attorney was ſo carefull to avoid the Conſequents of a Forfeiture of a Corporation, which are ſo great and deſtructive, that he would not by a Iudgment in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt a Corporation have the Corporation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, no more than he would by the Forfeiture <hi>ipſo facto</hi> have it determined, but that there ſhould be ſome Seiſure into the King's hands; but what that is, or how to be underſtood, I cannot imagine. For if the Corporation be not to be diſſolved and determined, in whom ſhould it reſt or remain after ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, or during ſuch Seiſure, ſhall it after Forfeiture remain in the ſame Perſons that it was in, ſhall it ſubſiſt, live and act as before? or ſhall it be in <hi>limbo Patrum,</hi> or <hi>in Nubibus?</hi> Is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration transferrable to any other Perſon or Perſons? Can a Corporation be conveyed or transferred? that is impoſſible; and ſo it appears in the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Norwich</hi> Caſe, and <hi>Fulcher</hi> and <hi>Heyward,</hi> and <hi>1 Inſt.</hi> in the Caſe of the Homage Anceſtrall before cited. That a Corporation is not transferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from one Body of Men to another; therefore the King cannot poſſibly have it, nor can he grant it. Ay, but ſaith Mr. Attorney, it ſhall be feifed, and in the King's hands; what is meant by theſe words? How can it be in the King's hands, if not transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Next, What ſhall the King doe with it, ſhall he grant it to others? No, that is impoſſible, by the Caſes cited, it ſo appears the King may make a new, but he cannot grant an old Corporation, becauſe not transferrable. Then if he cannot grant, if it be not transferrable, if a Corporation or Body Politick ſo by Law framed in ſimilitude of a natural Body, then it is no more transferrable than a natural Body is. The Body Politick cannot be taken out of the hands of the Perſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. From hence then, if this be ſo, it will follow of neceſſity that the Corporation, if it cannot be transferred to the King, or by the King's Grant out of the Perſons in whom it is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> remain where it is, or be diſſolved. Next, that which I ſhall ſhew is,</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:103424:52"/>
               <p>That by the words forfeiting and ſeiſing Liberties in thoſe old Records, it cannot be meant forfeiting and ſeiſing a Corporation or Body Politick they ſtill continued. But that which is the true ſenſe of theſe words, Forfeiting, and Seiſing Liberties in thoſe Records was, if the abuſe or miſuſe were of a particular Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, as of Courts, Priſons, Markets, or the like, the King had them forfeited to him. If the abuſe were by a Corporation, they Acted by their active Parts, by their Mayors, Bailiffs, Sheriffs, Coroners, or the like; the King ſeiſed theſe Offices, turned the Corporation Officers out, and put others into their Places. This was the Courſe in the Eires, where theſe Seiſures in thoſe days uſually were. But for ſeiſing Corporations as forfeit, there hath been no inſtance of it in any time, but the contrary is moſt evident. For the Corporations, notwithſtanding the ſuppoſed Forfeitures or Seiſures, remained ſtill in being; and this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent even to ſenſe. The Seiſures that have been mentioned, have been of <hi>London, Briſtol, Gloceſter, Cambridge</hi> and Cinque-Ports, <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Firſt, I offer to your Conſideration, whether theſe Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol, Gloceſter, Cambridge,</hi> and alſo the Cinque-Ports, ever ſince have not continually in all Pleadings, Claims and Titles, made themſelves a Title by Preſcription; Are they not by Preſcription to this day? Do they not claim their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Tolls, and all their Privileges by Preſcription? Do not the Acts of Parliament that immediately follow theſe Seiſures made by <hi>H. 4. H. 5. H. 6.</hi> in the times ſucceeding, all confirm their Privileges, not a word of granting new Privileges, but confirm the old; which ſhews plainly, that in thoſe days the Corporations were not, thought or imagined to be determin'd or diſſolv'd.</p>
               <p>By theſe Seiſures or ſuppoſed Forfeitures, the enjoynment or poſſeſſion for the ſpace of thrée Hundred years, is evidence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of their remaining and being Bodies Politick by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they could not be, if they were forfeited as pretended. For by Forfeiture, they muſt mean the loſing their Corporation, or being diveſted; no other ſenſe can be, or ever was of Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Could they forfeit them, and yet keep them? Could they loſe them, and yet have them? if they could not, then 'tis plain that ſince they always have had them, they never forfeited or loſt them. But for farther Evidence hereof, I ſhall make moſt plainly to appear, That during the very times of theſe Seiſures, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations remained and acted as Corporations; and that at that time, it was never thought or imagined, that during the Seiſures the Corporations were forfeit; all that was done was, that the Election of their Mayor or of their Sheriff was <hi>de facto</hi> taken from them, and either a <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> or a Mayor, by the King put over them, and continued till thoſe Kings diſpleaſures were over, and then they choſe theſe own Officers again; But no thought then of forfeiting the Corporation. By the City Books, as well
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103424:52"/> as Records, this is moſt evident. The putting a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> by King <hi>E. 1.</hi> continued for the ſpace of Eleven years, from the <hi>15 E. 1.</hi> to the <hi>26 E. 1.</hi> and then they choſe their Mayor again. By the City Books it appears, that their Court of Huſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all along continued, as at other times,<note place="margin">Lib.

               <p>The Liberties not forfeit, only ſeiſed into the Kings hands; ſo ſaith the Writ <hi>dudum capi fecimus in manum noſtrum.</hi> The Record of <hi>Cambridge</hi> I have looked upon, It plainly appears in it, that the Corporation was not forfeited and diſſolved, as you ſuppoſe. For it appears, that when they ſubmitted to the King to doe with their Franchiſes what he pleaſed; yet it was <hi>ſalvo</hi> to the Mayor and Bayliffs, their reſponſe to all other Matters. And afterwards, at the ſame time, the King grants to the ſame

               <p>Hereby it appears, that the courſe was not to forfeit or diſſolve the Corporation. They never were ſo unreaſonable; for hereby all their Lands and Goods, and all the Debts owing by them, or to them, would all be loſt: All they did was, they put in Officers to preſerve the Corporations. So that I think there is nothing more plain, that though the Liberties were ſeiſed, and that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> or Mayors, were put upon them; yet the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or Bodies Politick, or their Liberties, were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, or determined: If they had been either forfeited, or determined, could the Writs of Reſtitution have ſet them up again? The old could never be reſtored or ſet up again, but by Act of Parliament; they might have had new Charters, and have been made new Corporations, but the old could never have been reſtored, if once forfeited, as now imagined. So that the Point betwixt us is, Whether the Records of <hi>E. 1. E. 2.</hi> and <hi>R. 2.</hi> of Forfeitures and Seiſures of Liberties, ſuppoſing the Cauſes or Offences for which they were ſeiſed were very great and provoking, as in all probability they were, do prove that thereby the Corporations were forfeit, diſſolved, or determined? It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they were not forfeit. You can never avoid it. If abuſing the Franchiſe or Liberty of being a Corporation be a Forfeiture, as you affirm, and that they were ſeiſed for being forfeit; then the Offences that were committed by theſe Corporations in thoſe Princes times, were Forfeitures, and conſequently the Seiſures diſſolved the Corporations. They could not forfeit and loſe their Corporations, and yet keep them. And that they ſtill had their Being, is moſt evident by the Records of thoſe times, ſhewing, that they acted, and enjoyed their Corporations under thoſe Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, only a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> inſtead of a Mayor, all other things the ſame. That they have in all Ages ever ſince been allowed to be Corporations by Preſcription, never denied or queſtioned. That the Acts of Parliament immediately following, confirming their Privileges, never queſtioned their having them. Never any thoughts of making void any Forfeitures by theſe Acts, or any new Grants, but always pleaded by Preſcription. Theſe things plainly ſhew, that the Offences committed in thoſe times did not forfeit the Corporation; and all that dark Authority they have out of thoſe Records is directly againſt them, proves only that theſe Abuſes gave only Cauſe of Seiſure of ſome Offices, but no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Corporation, that ſtill continued.</p>
               <p>Having thus anſwered thoſe old Records, and ſhewn that they are of Authority for me againſt them. And ſince it hath been ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Caſe, whether a Corporation, or Body Politick be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderable or not? And inſiſted upon by the other ſide that it is, and from thence an Argument drawn to prove, that if ſurrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, 'tis forfeitable. Whether it be ſurrenderable or not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is alſo doubtfull, that I think a man cannot argue from it any thing. Firſt I am ſure there is no great reaſon why it ſhould be; for ſince that men that are of the Corporation take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103424:54"/> their coming to be free an Oath to preſerve the Rights, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Privileges of it; and ſince the Active Members are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted for all the other Members that elect and choſe them, and alſo for their Succeſſors; I cannot ſee how a man can ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſo doing.</p>

But this being not my queſtion, I intend not to debate it throughly, but to kéep to the point of a Forfeiture of a Body Politick or Corporation, and farther to examine the reaſonableneſs and juſtice of this Doctrine of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, and ſee how adequate and juſt it is; for that is the thing, I perceive deſired.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Firſt, Their Poſition is, That a Corporation or being of a Body Politick, is a Liberty or Franchiſe, and if abuſed or miſuſed, is forfeited, determined and diſſolved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may a little underſtand this Poſition, and conſider of Abuſe and Miſuſe, and of the extents and conſequences of it. By Abuſe or Miſuſe, every Act that a Corporation doth, that is not juſtifiable by Law, is, as I take it, an Abuſer or Miſſuſer. If a Corporation receive any Money that is not due to them, if it be by virtue of any By-Law, that is a Forfeiture, though it be but a Groat. What if they by their Common Seal command their Servant to enter into ſuch Lands, or Diſtrein ſuch a man's Cattle for Rent not due; Is not this a taking upon them to oppreſs the King's Subjects, and to extort from them their Lands or Moneys where not due? this is a Miſuſer. A Body Politick, as I have ſaid, is but a Perſon created in reſemblance of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſon, to have a Capacity to take, hold, and enjoy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ends and purpoſes. And hold or enjoy is not poſſible, without acting; and all that Act muſt of neceſſity be ſubject to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103424:54"/> Errors ſometimes, in their actions as natural Perſons are. And muſt it be ſo penal to them that every Error, Miſuſer or Abuſer, muſt be a Forfeiture? Can it be reaſonable or juſt in Law that this can be? Laws are made for Preſervation, not for Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; if every Abuſer or Miſuſer forfeit, be it a ſmall Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, is it either reaſonable or probable that any Law ſhall puniſh it with deſtruction of the Body? The greateſt Offence, be it Treaſon or Rebellion, or the leaſt illegal Act, Offence, or Misdemeanour, muſt have the ſame meaſure of Puniſhment by this Rule, and the Law then doth not diſtinguiſh. If a natural Body, or Perſon, hath a Market and orders his Servants to take ſuch Tolls, and he takes them; What would this Crime be, beſides Forfeiture of his Market? Why ſhould a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then not only in ſuch Caſe, or for any Offence or Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the value of a Peny, forfeit and loſe, as in the Caſe of High Treaſon, his Life or Being, Lands, Goods and all? This cannot be agréeable to any Rules or Reaſon of our Law; and therefore I take it, it cannot be the Law. The next thing is the Miſchiefs and Inconveniences.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. The Miſchiefs and Inconveniences that muſt attend this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Law of Forfeiting and Surrendring, if the Law be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Firſt, Let us conſider, whether this at one ſtroke do not make all the Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> of all ſorts, forfeit at once, and perhaps many years ſince. Is there any Corporation in <hi>England</hi> that hath not Offended or Tranſgreſſed? all manner of Corporations fall under this Rule. If they have tranſgreſſed or done any ſuch Act as makes a Forfeiture, (as every miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for any thing I can ſee to the contrary, doth,) whether the Corporation be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolved by the Offence committed, or elſe by the Iudgment, which muſt relate to the Offence, to avoid all mean Acts done by the Corporation. All that they have done ſince ſuch Miſcarriage they have done without right; and all that they think they have a Title to as a Corporation, they are miſtaken in, they have none. Perhaps if a Parliament ſhould be called, thoſe forfeited Corporations can lawfully ſend no Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes. I do not know whether I am miſtaken or not, I only offer this to Conſideration amongſt others: As, give me leave to venture a little farther upon theſe Conſiderations of Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Forfeitures of Corporations. Can a Biſhop, Dean and Chapter, Prebendary, Parſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurrender his Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Body Politick? If they can, moſt of them, perhaps, are of the foundation of the Crown, and had their Lands from thence. We have many Statutes made to reſtrain their Alienations: Thoſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not extend to hinder their Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Crown; but perhaps, out of hope of Preferment, they aliened to the Crown till the Statute of <hi>1 Jacobi cap. 3.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103424:55"/> took away that Power alſo of conveying to the Crown: Can theſe forfeit the Corporations? Perhaps we are Sinners all, or at leaſt as the ballance at ſome time or other may be holden, may be found too light; we are upon a point that goes to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, fear, and favour; what may it doe, and what may it not doe? If they may ſurrender a forfeit, what effects may this have upon the whole Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate? If this had been known in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, perhaps there would have been no great need of Acts of Parliament to make him Head of the Church, or to have diſſolved the Monaſteries. Suppoſe that Colleges, Hoſpitals, and other Corporations founded for Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can ſurrender or forfeit; the preſent Maſters and Fellows, and the Heirs of the Donors may truck; what effect may this have upon them? what ways may they find out? Alſo Cities and Boroughs; what Diviſions and Contentions hath it already produced, ſome for ſurrendring, others for defending what Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities are about it: The end of the Law is to preſerve Peace and Quiet. Diviſions and Diſſentions frequently end in the Deſtruction of both Parties. The Citizens and Burgeſſes are, I think, three parts of four of the Houſe of Commons. It is conſiderable what Effects this may have in Parliaments, our Laws and Poſterities perhaps not a little concerned herein; and if ſo, ſurely this is a great Caſe. But if only the City of <hi>London,</hi> give me leave to ſee what the ill Conſequences and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs will be. Arguments from Miſchiefs and Inconveniences are forcible Arguments in Law.</p>
               <p>

Secondly, All their Markets, Tolls, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they claim by Preſcription, whereby the Government, and the Honour of the City, the Publick Halls, Gates, Priſons, Bridges, and other Edifices, are in a great meaſure maintained. Thirdly, All the Debts owing to the City, and all their perſonal Eſtate by the death or diſſolution of the Corporation will be gone, but who ſhall have them: perhaps, <hi>non difinitur in jure.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the Liberties and cuſtomary Privileges that the Freemen of the City, their Wives, and Children claim, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to have cuſtomary ſhares in their Husbands or Fathers Eſtates. To be exempt from Tolls. In other Towns, Ports and Markets; to exclude Foreigners and Vnfreemen from uſing their Trades in <hi>London,</hi> and many others. Fifthly, All the Acts of Parliament that give particular Powers and Authorities to the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, or Common Council, or Corporation reſpecting
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103424:55"/> either the Government or Iuſtice of the City; as about Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and payment of their Dues, Buildings, Paving of Strats, Sewers, Enſurance Office, and many others. Sixthly, What ſhall become of the Orphans, and all the Moneys and Debts the City owes, and all the Charities in the City? We have ſeen the City burnt, and may remember what a Swarm were unhived thereby; but we never yet ſaw it diſſolved, nor are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences meaſurable. And though it pleaſe his Majeſty upon the Diſſolution of this to grant a new Charter, yet it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any of theſe things can be preſerved: Their Lands, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Debts, Privileges, Cuſtoms, are all perſonal, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Corporation, and muſt live and dye with it; the ſaid Acts of Parliament are all fixed to this Corporation, and ſo are the Charities, and cannot, as I conceive, be ever transferred to any other to be new created. A new Corporation can be in no ſucceſſion or privity with the old.</p>
               <p>If a Body Politick be once diſſolved, though a new one be founded of the ſame Name,<note place="margin">Inſt. 1. 102. b</note> that can have no ſucceſſion to the old, nor come in privity to it: Therefore is it that in the Deau and Chapter of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> Caſe, and in <hi>Fulcher</hi> and <hi>Heyward's</hi> Caſe, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the old Corporation is inſiſted on. If every Abuſer committed by a Corporation, be a Forfeiture, Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diſſolution, Is there any one in <hi>England</hi> not forfeited and diſſolved? Abuſe is a word of wonderfull large ſenſe; when the Law ſpeaks of a Franchiſe abuſed or miſuſed, it is applicable to a particular Franchiſe, as to a Market, Court, or the like, and if that Franchiſe be miſuſed or abuſed, in Oppreſſion or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, contrary to the ends of it, ſome certainty there is in it: But the Abuſe of a Corporation extends to all its Acts, and all Eſtates of the Corporation, and all the Privileges of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and all that are concerned in them, are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for every Abuſe, or Miſuſe, or Miſ-act, or Treſpaſs, how ſmall ſoever. Who can tell in the Actions of a Perſon what may be taken to be ill or illegally done, or an Abuſe? Who will truſt a Corporation, if its Duration and Exiſtence be ſo fickle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that every Abuſer or Miſurer ſhall forfeit it? There will be no need of Officers to be amoved, thereby to determine this Corporation at will and Pleaſure, this Poſition contains enough to doe all. Theſe great conſequences attending this Doctrine of Forfeiture, are Reaſons to prove the Law otherwiſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Obj. But,</hi> ſaith Mr. Attorney, (if I underſtand him,) <hi>we do not intend to deſtroy the Corporation, though we ſay in our Pleading that you have forfeited your old Corporation, that you have without any lawfull Authority uſurped upon the King, and pray in our Replication, that de Libertate Privilegio &amp; Francheſia illa, (viz.</hi> the being a Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) <hi>abindicantur &amp; excludentur. Theſe are but words of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103424:56"/> form, we only will lay the King's hands gently upon it, and ſeiſe it, but the Corporation ſhall not be deſtroyed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is wonderfull, and a great Compliment to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as I take it; let us not flatter or deceive one another. We are not now in the irregular days in the Records mentioned, nor in ſuch fort of Proceedings as in thoſe diſtracted times. Let us not go by blind conjectures, out of old Records, and bring in unknown ways. We are now in <hi>a Quo Warranto,</hi> which, as Mr. Attorney truly ſaith, is in the nature of a VVrit of Right; and a VVrit of right is the higheſt. VVrit that is in the Law,<note place="margin">Rep. 9. 28. Inſt. 2. 282, 495.</note> and the Iudgment therein, and in this <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> muſt be concluſive to all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If given againſt the Defendants, it muſt conclude them for ever, and diſſolve their Corporation, and if given againſt the King, he ſhall never hereafter bring it in queſtion for any cauſe precedent. <hi>Cook's</hi> Entries <hi>527.

And to talk of a Iudgment of a Seiſure, what is the meaning of it, or ſuch Iudgment? Is it final or not final? The Court muſt give a final Iudgment, that the Party, if he think fit, may have his VVrit of Errour. The Court will not take any of your old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to go by, if any ſuch to be found, that would warrant any other Iudgment: Therefore a Seiſure, without ſuch a Iudgment that determines the Corporation, cannot be any way brought to paſs, as I believe, nor can I underſtand in whom, by your Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, you would have the old Corporation to ſubſiſt. Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Perſons in whom it now ſubſiſts I think is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but diſſolved by your Iudgment it may be: And I hope your Lordſhip will not be induced by ſingular unwarrantable Things. That a Iudgment ſhould be given that ſhall neither diſſolve the Corporation, nor continue it, that ſhall neither be for Plaintiff nor Defendant, that ſhall leave the Corporation neither alive nor dead, but <hi>in Tranſitu,</hi> or <hi>Limbo Patrum:</hi> A Iudgment

Corp. 24. 34.</note> They cannot commit any actual Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs or Diſſeiſin, except under their common Seal, by command precedent, or aſſent ſubſequent; when our Books ſay, that they are a Body Politick, and reſt or have their being in Intendment or Conſideration of Law; thereby is meant, that that they are by Law enabled to Act to particular ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, anſwerable to their ends and creations. Their ends or creations are only to be ſubſervient to the publick Good, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Preſervation of the City or Town Incorporate, of the Members thereof. And if there be any Act done by the Members that are the active part of ſuch Corporation, to any other intent, end, or purpoſe: This, not the Act of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but of the particular Members, and they only anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for it. And as to particular Offences and Miſcarriages in this Caſe alleadged, it cannot be denied, but that the particular Members are anſwerable for it; and if they, then according to all Books, they ought not to be doubly chargeable or anſwerable in both Capacities. And the Caſe cited out of <hi>Bagg</hi>'s Caſe, of a Fréeman convict of Perjury, and thereupon Disfranchiſed, doth not prove that they ſhall be puniſhed in a double Capacity, for the Corporation is not thereby puniſhed, but preſerved. The being of a Body Politick, is only a Capacity, and in reſemblance of a natural Body, and no more forfeitable than a natural Body. It is ſeiſing &amp; forfeiting of Liberties that we meet with, that is ſuch as are generally ſpoken of; as Markets, Courts, Iurisdictions, and the like: And in the old Records, by ſeiſing the Liberties of a Corporation, is meant, the taking from them their Officers, and putting in others upon them for a time. But a forfeiting, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and determining the Body Politick, never was yet done or known, nor, as reaſonable to believe, ever entred into any mans thoughts till now; for I have already ſhewn, that Offences and Miſcarriages that were committed by the Corporations in thoſe troubleſome Times of <hi>E. 1. E. 2.</hi> and <hi>R. 2.</hi> for which their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties were ſeiſed, were not Forfeitures and Determinations of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103424:57"/> thoſe Corporations, they all remain Corporations by Preſcription to this day: And I have alſo taken notice, that the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that were made in the ſucceeding Kings Reigns, of <hi>H. 4. H. 5.</hi> and <hi>H. 6.</hi> are only Acts of Confirmation to the Cities and Boroughs, of the Liberties and Privileges. From that time till within theſe three years, I believe it never entred into any mans thoughts that a Corporation was forfeitable; for farther proof whereof, divers other Statutes, and the whole ſeries of matter is Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">15 H. 6. cap. 6.</note>The Statute of <hi>H. 6.</hi> that provides againſt Abuſes and Exactions made by Societies Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by their By-Laws and Ordinances, and appoints a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ten Pounds, and of their power to make By-Laws. To what end ſhould this be, if the Corporations themſelves were forfeited, or thought ſo to be.</p>
               <p>The Statute of <hi>H. 7.</hi> recites the Statute of <hi>H. 6.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</note> and the Exactions and Abuſes by Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, by their By-Laws and Ordinances, and Ordinances, and appoints a Penalty of forty Pounds upon a they exact Money by an unlawfull and unwarranted By-Law, not examined and ſigned by the Chancellor and Chief Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>The Statute of the <hi>12 H. 7. cap. 6.</hi> ſets forth grievous Exactions by the Fellowſhip of <hi>Merchant Adventurers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</note> by their By-Laws, and impoſeth a Penalty for the future.</p>

If in thoſe times it had béen thought or imagined that a Corporation had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable, every of theſe Offences forfeited it, what need farther Remedy. In the Caſe of <hi>Hoddy</hi> and <hi>Wheehouſe,</hi> of exceſſive Toll by the Town of <hi>Northampton.</hi>

               <p>So that I think I may conclude with the tumultuous times of <hi>E. 1. E. 2.</hi> and <hi>R. 2.</hi> what was then done, doth plainly ſhew the Corporations were not forfeit or diſſolved. That by all the Acts of Parliament, and Proceedings in almoſt all the Reigns of any length or duration, from that time to this very Caſe, the Opinions and Thoughts of men were otherwiſe; as by the Statutes and Tranſactions appears, Not one Opinion, Book, or Authority produced, or to be found.</p>
               <p>The great Concern not only of this great City, but of all other Cities, Towns, and Corporations Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, all depend upon it. And which is more than all, the very Government by Law Eſtabliſhed, will be in great danger of Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by it.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103424:57"/>
               <p>I have argued long, and tryed your Lordſhips patience; the weight and length of the Caſe, and rareneſs of the matter, there never having been the like before in any Age, will, I hope, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me. But beſides the whole frame and foundation that the other ſide have laid, being all built upon general undigeſted Notions, as I take it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Abuſer and Miſuſer of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties forfeits them, without diſtinguiſhing betwixt one thing and another. That the words Forfeiting and Seiſing Liberties, found in old Records, ſhould be Authorities to prove forfeiting Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or Beings of the Body Politick, though no ſuch thing then, or at any time ſince, till very lately, ever thought on or imagined. It was neceſſary for me to open and ſet forth theſe general notions, and to explain and diſtinguiſh; which, I hope I have done, that it may appear what the ſenſe of them is, how far they agree with Law and Iuſtice, and how far not. And if in the doing hereof, or the ſetting out the repugnant or inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Matters or Opinions ariſing in this Caſe to maintain this <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> I have expreſſed my ſelf in any other manner than became me, I humbly beg pardon for it; and that it may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Cauſe, nor prejudice it.</p>
               <p>Vpon the whole Matter,</p>
               <p>If this Information brought againſt the Body Politick for Vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to be a Body Politick, ought to have been brought againſt the particular Perſons.</p>
               <p>If it be repugnant or contradictory, that a Corporation can uſurp to be a Corporation; that a Body Politick or Being can uſurp to be a Body Politick or Being, before it had a Being, or to be that ſame Body Politick or Being, which it was when it did uſurp.</p>
               <p>If forfeiting a Franchiſe, or Liberty, or other Eſtate, cannot determine or veſt that Franchiſe or Eſtate in the King till the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture appear on Record. Then the old Corporation ſuppoſed to be forfeited, if it were ſo, did notwithſtanding, and yet doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in being, there being no Record to determine it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that which is pretended a new one by Vſurpation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>If by Seiſure into the King's hands (as pretended) the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Corporation be intended; How inconſiſtent is it with Law or Iuſtice to continue any thing in the King that is wrongfully uſurp'd, and the Parties to be puniſhed, fined, and committed for uſurping.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Attorney's Replication taking iſſue upon our Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Corporation, and going over and alleadging ſeveral diſtinct Cauſes of Forfeitures, cannot by Law be maintained; and in the Example doth introduce a way to bring all mens Eſtates ſubject to Mr. Attorneys will and pleaſure. For, let any mans Right be as good as can be, it will be ſcarce poſſible to defend it, if ſuch Pleadings as in his Replication be allowable by Law.</p>
               <p>Then be the matter in Law as much againſt us as poſſible; yet Mr. Attorney can have no Iudgment for him upon this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:103424:58"/>
               <p>Next, Suppoſing the Information all good in Law. Yet,</p>
               <p>If the Iudgments, Records, and Authority that have been cited by them for Seiſures, do plainly ſhew that Seiſures and Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very different in their Natures. That the Corporations all continued notwithſtanding the Seiſures: And the Seiſure was only the Kings putting in Mayors and Officers to act in them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the others Elected or Conſtituted by the Corporation, and they remain Corporations by Preſcription to this day, and never were forfeited, diſſolved, or determined by ſuch Seiſures.</p>
               <p>If the General Authorities in Books that the Miſuſing or Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Franchiſe be truly applicable to Franchiſes (that are Eſtates and Intereſts grantable or conveyable from man to man) and never were intended of ſuch a thing as is rather a Capacity or Being, than a Franchiſe.</p>
               <p>If there be no Caſe, or Precedent, or Opinion to be found for it. If of the contrary, the particular Caſes cited prove, that where the Corporations have by Miſcarriages forfeited particular Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes, they do not forfeit their Corporations. If there be ſcarce any Corporation in <hi>England,</hi> that have not at ſome time or other done ſomething they ſhould not, or omitted to do ſomething they ſhould, and thereby forfeited their Corporation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all are Vſurpers, and their Corporate Acts ſince done all void.</p>
               <p>If the Corporation here hath done nothing, but that the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, are only Delegates, Deputies, or Miniſters of the Corporation for particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>If Servants, Deputies, or Delegates, doe that which they have no Authority to doe, they muſt anſwer for it in their own Perſons; but their Maſters, or thoſe that deputed or delegated them for another purpoſe, they are innocent; they ſhall not ſuffer by it, though no Acts of Parliament had been in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>If the Acts of Parliament againſt Seiſing the Liberties of the City, for, or by reaſon of any miſcarriage of their Officers or Miniſters, extend to theſe Acts of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council.</p>
               <p>If ſo be that theſe Acts were the Acts of the Corporation; Yet with Submiſſion, if they have ſhewn a good and legal Right by their Cuſtom and Title, to make By-Laws for regulating and ſettling the Markets and Tolls, and that which they have done be as pleaded reaſonable, and that there was reaſonable Ground at that time for their Petition which they have ſet forth.</p>
               <p>If all theſe particulars that I have now ſumm'd up be againſt me, then Iudgment muſt be againſt me; though I know not what that Iudgment can be.</p>
               <p>But if any one of theſe particulars, thus repeated, be for me, and againſt Mr. Attorney; then Mr. Attorney can have no Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the City; But Iudgment muſt be for them. Which I humbly pray.</p>

            <p>THE Queſtion concerning the Surrender of Corporations or Bodies Politick, not being directly in the Caſe, but in the Arguments on both ſides inſiſted on, it may not be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtate that Point, and collect what hath been in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates or Arguments alleadged on either ſide, that the eaſier View and Iudgment may be made of it.</p>
            <p>By Surrender in this Queſtion is by both ſides meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſome Deed or Inſtrument in writing, whereby a Body Corporate or Politick can ſurrender and diſſolve it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It is agreed that a Body Politick may be diſſolved, either by the Death of the Perſons incorporate, or their Refuſer to act, nominate, or elect Officers or Miniſters, ſo as there remain not ſufficient, authorized or enabled by their Charter or Conſtitution, to preſerve their Being: This is admitted to be a Ceſſer, or Diſſolution of the Corporation, and ſuch a ſort of yielding up, or Surrender, is admitted poſſible.</p>
            <p>But whether by any Deed or Inſtrument in Writing it can be done, that is the Queſtion intended.</p>
            <p>For the Surrender, It hath been alleadged,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Being of a Body Politick is a Liberty, Privilege, and Franchiſe, that had its Commencement by the King's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or by Preſcription, which ſuppoſes a Charter; and if it have its beginning and Creation by Charter, which is the Kings Deed that grants it, by Deed again it may be regranted and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered.</p>
            <p>And 'tis a Maxim in Law,
<q>Unumquodque diſſolvi poteſt eod' modo quo ligatur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And inſtances in Fairs, Markets, Leets, and ſuch like Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes, granted by Charter, which, ſay they, may be ſurrendered by Deed, or Regrant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is neceſſary that it ſhould be diſſolvable by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, perhaps a Town may come to decay, and not be able to defray the charge that the Support and Maintainance of the Corporation may require; for every one ſees that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and Officers muſt be, and theſe cannot be bought, or maintained, without Eſtates, and poor men are not able, without ruine to their Families, to bear the Magiſtracies and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103424:60"/> And therefore neceſſary there ſhould be a Power in them to ſurrender.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Books and Caſes in Law do prove, That a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, or Body Politick, may ſurrender itſelf, and thereby be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dy.</hi> 273. There the Caſe is thus ſtated:</p>
            <p>The Deanry of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Wells</hi> was diſſolved by the Surrender of <hi>Fitz-Williams, tempore H.</hi> 8. And the Prebend of <hi>Currey,</hi> in the ſame Church, was alſo ſurrendered by <hi>Goodman,</hi> Prebendary there, 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. And in this Year the Diſſolution of the Deanry was confirmed, and the Deanry extinct by Act of Parliament, and a new Dean erected and created, to which new Deanry the Lands and Poſſeſſions of the old were annext, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Poſſeſſions, and the Nomination of the new Dean and Succeſſors, given by that Act to the King, and that he ſhould have the ſame Power in <hi>Choro &amp; Capitulo,</hi> as the old Dean had, ſaving to all Strangers, other than the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> the old Dean, and the old Prebendary, and their Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>In this caſe 'tis admitted, and taken for granted, that the Deanry, and alſo the Prebend were ſurrendered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dy.</hi> 282. There the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> had two Chapters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dean and Chapter of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and both theſe uſed to confirm the Biſhops Leaſes. The Dean and Chapter of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> by Deed under their common Seal, gave and ſurrendered all their Church, Houſes, Lands, and Poſſeſſions, to the King, without licenſe or conſent of their Biſhop, being their Ordinary, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the moſt part of the Prebends.</p>
            <p>After this Surrender their Church was uſed as the Common Hall, for the four Courts in the Term there; and a Leaſe is made by the Archbiſhop, confirmed by the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> only, and whether the Succeſſor of the Archbiſhop were bound by this Leaſe, was the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Iudges in <hi>Ireland</hi> were divided in Opinion, and thereupon the Caſe ſent over for the Opinion of the Iudges here, and the Opinions and Reſolutions of five Iuſtices, <hi>viz. Catlyn, Dyer, Saunders, Welſh,</hi> and <hi>Carus,</hi> certified to the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under their Hands, were, <hi>quod non fuit aliud Capitulum in eſſe tempore confirmationis Dimiſſion' pred' niſi</hi> Chriſt-Church <hi>tantum, quia Corporatio &amp; Capitulum Sancti</hi> Patrick <hi>fuit per donum &amp; ſurſum reddition' Decani &amp; Capituli pred' legitime diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutum abſque conſenſu Archiepiſcopi.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Jones</hi> 168. The Opinion of Iuſtice <hi>Jones</hi> there, That a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration may be diſſolved by an Act proper, <hi>viz.</hi> by Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it hath been answered,</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:103424:60"/>
            <p n="1">1. Admitting it to be true, that to be a Body Politick, is a Liberty, Privilege, and Franchiſe, created by Charter, which is the King's Deed.</p>
            <p>Yet it doth not follow that it may be ſurrendered by Deed.</p>
            <p>For the Charters that incorporate the Citizens, or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, of ſuch a City, Town, or Place, and make them a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy capable of taking and having Lands, Goods, or Chattels, to ſue and to be ſued, and to have a Common Seal, and to act according to the Powers, Ends, and Purpoſes in their Charters contained, only give them a capacity for thoſe Ends.</p>
            <p>The Liberty, Privilege, and Franchiſe that they have goes no farther.</p>
            <p>They cannot transfer this Privilege, or Franchiſe, to any other Perſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe are only perſonal Franchiſes or Capacities, fixed in the Perſons in whom they are granted.</p>
            <p>Like to Patents of Denization granted to Aliens, whereby a capacity is granted to have, hold, and act, as a natural born Subject.</p>
            <p>Grants of Enfranchiſing a Villain.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Grants that cannot be ſurrendered.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Franchiſes and Capacities like this.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Exceptions to the General Rule,
<q>Unumquodque diſſolvitur eodem modo, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo of Fairs, Markets, Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are created by Charter, they may be granted over, or granted to the King; but if they be regranted to the King, they are not extinct, but remain in the King.</p>
            <p>Abbot of <hi>Strata Marcell</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Rep.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>b</hi> ſhews the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thus:</p>
            <p>When the King grants Franchiſes that were, in the Crown before the Grant, as <hi>Bona Felonium,</hi> Deodands, Wreck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe come again to the Crown, they are merged in the Crown, and the King is ſeiſed of them <hi>jure Coronae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when a Privilege, Liberty, Franchiſe or Iurisdiction, was at firſt erected or ordained by the King, there, by the coming of it again to the Crown, they are not extinct, and inſtanceth in Fairs, Markets, Hundreds, Léets, <hi>&amp; ſimilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not diſſolv'd or gone, for thereby Subjects would be prejudiced: For if the Court ſhould be ſo granted, and thereby diſſolved, the Subjects Iudgments and Suits in thoſe Courts would all be loſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are other Exceptions to that general Rule,
<q>Unumquod<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Reaſon given for the Surrenders of Corporations from the poverty that may happen for the conveniency of ſome Corporation is anſwerable; for that doth not very frequently happen: But when it doth happen, if they are weary of it, they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103424:61"/> may let it alone, and not act or chooſe Officers, it will ceaſe of it ſelf, néed not be at the charge or trouble of a Surrender.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, the Inconveniences are very great, and are ſome of them before ſpecified.</p>
            <p>The Eſtabliſhment of the Church is all in Corporations, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deans, Chapters, Prebends, Parſons, Vicars; if theſe be ſurrenderable, as by the Caſes cited, without conſent of Biſhops; (a Prebend is, as to his being, but as a Parſon, or a Vicar.) The Vniverſities, Colleges, Hoſpitals, all the Cities, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Towns, Trades, and Myſteries, are Corporations; if theſe be ſurrenderable, it affects our old Government.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> As for the Books and Authorities. <hi>Dy. 273.</hi> the Diſſolution of the Corporation thereby ſurrendred, is only mention'd in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Caſe, it is not debated, nor was it material in the Caſe: For the Act of Parliament there ſettled the new Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Prebendary, and the matter of the Caſe ariſeth upon the Deprivation of Dean <hi>Goodman,</hi> and the appeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of that Sentence, there is not as much as any Opinion in the Caſe concerning the Diſſolution or Surrender, whether good or bad.</p>
            <p>But what may reaſonably be inferr'd from that Caſe is, That the Surrender and Diſſolution thereby was not good in Law; for if it had, what needed the having an Act of Parliament to ſecure againſt the old Dean and Prebendary; which appears in the Caſe was had. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Co. Rep.</hi> 3. 75. <hi>b.</hi> in the Caſe of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Norwich,</hi> This Caſe of <hi>Dyer</hi> is cited, and there expreſly ſaid, that that Surrender was not thought good, till confirm'd by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 282. of the Surrender of the Dean and Chapter of St. <hi>Patrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Opinion of the Iudges there given, is by all the Iudges, 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. in the Caſe of <hi>Heyward</hi> and <hi>Fulcher,</hi> in <hi>Jones,</hi> 168. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be Law, and ſaid to be a private reſolution.</p>
            <p>So that theſe two Caſes in <hi>Dyer,</hi> having béen by thoſe later Authorities denied, remain no Authorities. And as for the other Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> The opinion of Iuſtice <hi>Jones</hi> 168. that a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be diſſolv'd by a proper Act, <hi>viz.</hi> by Reſignation.</p>
            <p>That is true; taken in the ſenſe he ſpeaks it, it is ſpoken of a Dean and Chapter reſigning to the Ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> The Dean reſigning his place of Dean, and the Prebendaries of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reſigning their Prebends to the Ordinary; whereby their Churches and Prebends became void, and to be ſupplied by the reſpective Patron, collating or preſenting, as in Caſes of Reſignation, by any Parſon or Vicar to his Ordinary.</p>
            <p>But this is nothing of a Surrender of the Body Politick to the King, and thereby diſſolving the Corporation, and deſtroying all ſupply, by new Preſentments or Collations.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:103424:61"/>
            <p>And this appears by the very words of Iuſtice <hi>Jones</hi> there; for when he ſaith they may be diſſolv'd by a proper Act, <hi>viz.</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation; the next words are, or by death of the whole Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the King being Patron, 'tis in his Election whether he will collate <hi>de novo,</hi> or not, and till he collates the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in ſuſpenſe; but if the Biſhop be Patron, then the Biſhop upon the Reſignation, hath power to collate, and thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Corporation: So that it is very plain, that the Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he ſpeaks of, is not meant for any Surrender to the King, or any thing that determines the Corporation, except the Patron will not collate, and thereby ſuffer the Corporation to ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But of the contrary, that a Corporation cannot be diſſolv'd by any Surrender.</p>
            <p>The Suppreſſion and Diſſolution of the Abbies, Priories, and Monaſteries, by <hi>H.</hi> 8. was no Diſſolution of their Bodies Politick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Br. Extinguiſhment,</hi> 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Br. Corporation,</hi> 78.</p>

               <hi>Davies, Rep.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moore's Rep.</hi> 282. Though their Houſes and all their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were gone, and the Perſons either diſcharged of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or ſent into other Houſes; yet reſolved, that the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remain'd. And it can ſcarce be imagin'd, but in ſome of thoſe Caſes it would have been practiſed, or at leaſt ſomething ſaid about ſurrendring their Body Politick, if it had been then thought ſurrenderable.</p>
            <p>But the Caſes of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Norwich, Rep.</hi> 3. 41 <hi>Eliz.</hi> before cited.</p>
            <p>And the Caſe of <hi>Heyward</hi> and <hi>Fulcher</hi> before mention'd in 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jones,</hi> 168.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palm. Rep.</hi> 500, 501.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anderſ.</hi> 2. 120.</p>
            <p>Have been cited as Iudgments againſt Surrenders by all the Iudges of the King's Bench.</p>
            <p>The Caſe was, That the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Norwich,</hi> 3 <hi>Junii</hi> 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. ſurrendred to the King their Cathedral Church, &amp; all their Mannors, Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Liberties, Spiritual and Temporal, by whatſoever names they are known, or which they have or ought to have in the Right of their Church.</p>
            <p>And by the Caſe 41 <hi>Eliz. Co. Rep.</hi> 3. 74.</p>
            <p>And the Opinion of all the Iudges of the King's Bench.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. adjudged that this was no Surrender of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That the words of the Surrender do not ſhew any intent to ſurrender the Corporation, but only the Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> The being of a Corporation, is a Franchiſe or Liberty.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103424:62"/>
            <p>And there is an expreſs Surrender of all Franchiſes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties Spiritual and Temporal, by what name ſoever known, which they have in the right of their Church.</p>
            <p>And this was a Spiritual Franchiſe, which they had in right of their Church.</p>
            <p>Next, This Surrender was made with intent to diſſolve the Corporation, and to have a new one erected; this appears by the new Charter of Erection, made in <hi>November</hi> following; which recites the Surrender made to that intent.</p>
            <p>It is not any where in the many Arguments of that Caſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that there wanted words in the Surrender to doe it, which would have been, if that had been the Ground of their Iudgment.</p>
            <p>In the Caſe cited out of <hi>Dyer</hi> 282. there the words of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render were, that they ſurrendered their Church, Houſes, Lands, and Poſſeſſions, which are not half ſo large and ample words as in this Surrender are contain'd; and the other ſide cite that as an Authority to prove a Corporation ſurrender'd, and admit the words there ſufficient, and deny them to be ſufficient here, though much more large, expreſs, and general.</p>
            <p>The arguing there in <hi>Palmer</hi> 501. that it is againſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Conſtitution of Corporations, that by the words put in their Charters, by their very Conſtitution are to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Succeſſion, <hi>perpetuis temporibus duratur,</hi> and which by their Oaths they are sworn to preſerve, that they ſhould be <hi>felo de ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the expreſs words of the Iudges reported in theſe Books, ſhew their Opinion, that the Corporation could not be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jones,</hi> 168. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Iuſtice, there ſaith, that the Dean and Chapter cannot ſurrender their Corporation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palm.</hi> 501. <hi>Whitlock Inſt.</hi> there ſaith, For that that the Dean and Chapter are Counſel to the Biſhop inſtituted to that purpoſe, they cannot diſſolve themſelves, for the Politick Corporation is the Soul to the Body, that cannot be granted or ſever'd; though the King can create a Corporation, he cannot diſſolve it. And <hi>Jones Inſt.</hi> there 502. ſaith, That the Dean and Chapter were Counſel to the Biſhop, and cannot deſtroy themſelves; if they could, great Inconvenience thereby will enſue to the Church.</p>
